A mushroom used to create a lacquer (Resina) that hardens other fungal building and crafting substances, particularly zurkhwood. Notably, when consumed by a myconid, it gives them overlapping ripples of hard plating, giving them a natural AC of 14 + Dexterity bonus (max 2), with disadvantage to Stealth checks. This lasts for one hour before the plates turn brittle and fall off. It can be used by those proficient in either herbalist's kit or alchemist's supplies into a more potent armoring elixir: solid (armor as scale mail, 5gp), sturdy (armor as half plate, 75gp), or heavy (armor as splint mail, 20gp). These last for a week before flaking off.
