The nobility of the city were divided into clans, whose lords were called lairds. Power in the city was shared between the great clans (especially the merchant clans), the king (called Deepking[2]), and the city's derro savants. Entities holding power were the Council of Lairds, the derro Council of Savants, Clan Cairngorm (a power clan of stone giants), and the Merchant Council.[12]

Deepking [[Horgar Steelshadow V]]


**Hammerer**:
The hammerer is a digging machine with a duergar strapped inside it—typically a punishment for those whose work ethic wavers. The machine's mechanism transforms the captive duergar's pain into energy that powers the device, which is typically used to dig tunnels and repel invaders.

The duergar hammerer is a digging machine and siege engine, used to dig tunnels and besiege enemy fortifications.

These machines are deployed to assist with construction projects and war. Some duergar bravely volunteer to become hybrids, while other duergar are forced into the fusion by Underdark tyrants. Unless incapacitated, the duergar inside a machine can extricate themself from it over the course of a short rest, completing the process at the rest's end.

Creative duergar engineers have built numerous war machines, including some that can be fused with a duergar. Such a duergar-machine hybrid is fueled by the duergar's psionic energy, and the duergar inside the machine can psychically channel pain into power when attacked.


**despot**: Duergar despots replace parts of their bodies with mechanical devices that they control through their psionic abilities.


Council of sevens is a circle of 36 derro who have a lot of power, and can decide many things. The rest of their people live in squalor.
