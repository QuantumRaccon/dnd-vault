When an encounter occurs during the adventurers' journey, a number of factors will play into its setup and potential difficulty

# Space and Marching Order

Ask the players to establish two marching orders for the characters -- one for moving single file and one for moving two abreast. Then when an encounter occurs, roll a **d6**. On a roll of 1-2, the pary is traveling through a narrow passageway, so position the adventurers in a the single-file marching order. On a roll of 3-4, the characters are traveling through a standard passageway and can use the two- abreast marching order. On a roll of 5-6, the encounter occurs in a large open area, so allow the players to position the characters wherever they like. 

# Illumination 

Roll a **d6** to determine how an encounter are is illuminated. On a roll 1-3, the area is dimly lit by the phosphorescent moss and lichen common in the Underdark, or by [[Faerzress]]. On a roll of 4-6, the area is dark except for whatever light sources the characters might have.
