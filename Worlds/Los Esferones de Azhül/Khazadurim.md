Here are some original and creepy encounters for the city of Khazadurim:

1.  **Whispers in the Dark**: As the party explores the city, they begin to hear faint whispers echoing through the abandoned corridors. The whispers seem to be guiding them towards a hidden chamber, where they find a group of dwarven spirits trapped in a state of eternal torment. The spirits were cursed to relive their final moments before the city's fall, and they plead with the party to release them from their suffering.
    
2.  **The Crystal Cavern**: The party stumbles upon a cavern filled with bioluminescent crystals that emit an eerie, otherworldly glow. As they venture deeper into the cavern, they encounter a creature composed entirely of the same crystal material. The Crystal Guardian, a construct created by the dwarves to protect their treasures, has gone rogue and now attacks anyone who enters its domain.
    
3.  **The Bone Collector**: The party encounters a strange, hunched figure collecting the bones of the fallen dwarves. The creature, known as the Bone Collector, is a twisted, corrupted form of a dwarven cleric who was unable to escape the city when it fell. Now, the Bone Collector seeks to gather the bones of its kin to perform a dark ritual in a desperate attempt to resurrect the city's lost inhabitants.
    
4.  **The Fleshweaver**: In the depths of the city, the party comes across a chamber filled with grotesque, malformed creatures stitched together from the bodies of various Underdark inhabitants. The Fleshweaver, a deranged and mutated former citizen of Khazadurim, has been experimenting with dark magic to create an army of loyal servants. The Fleshweaver sees the party as potential subjects for its twisted experiments and tries to capture them for its macabre collection.
    
5.  **Echoes of the Past**: While exploring the city, the party triggers an ancient magical trap that causes them to experience vivid, horrifying visions of the city's final moments. They witness the dwarves' desperate attempts to save their city, the devastating power of the Heart of the Mountain, and the terrible price paid for their failure. The party must find a way to break free from these nightmarish visions before they become trapped in the past forever.
