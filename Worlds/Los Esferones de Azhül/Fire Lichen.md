![[Fire Lichen.webp]]

Pale orange-white in color, fire lichen thrives on warmth, so it grows in regions of geothermal heat. Fire lichen can be ground and fermented into a hot, spicy paste, which is spread on sporebread ([[bluecap]]) or added to soups or stews to flavor them. Duergar also ferment fire lichen into a fiercely hot liquor.
