Adventurers sometime choose their path by following the tracks of other creatures —or other creatures might track the adventurers! Tracking is a **Wisdom (Survival)** check, with a DC based on the age and overtness of the tracks and the terrain in question, or on a DC equal to the results of the opposed Wisdom (Survival) check used to hide tracks. You might require trackers to make a new check in any of the following circumstances:

- This check must be made at the end of every rest (long and short), as well as after every encounter if it was a drawback. 
- The trail crosses an obstacle, such as a river, that shows no tracks. 
- The weather conditions or terrain changes in a way that makes tracking harder. 

The DC for the check depends on how well the ground show signs of a creature's passage. No roll is necessary in situations where the tracks are obvious. In situations where there is no trail to follow, you can rule that tracking is impossible. 

The [[Tracking DCs]] table offers guidelines for setting the DC or, if you prefer, you can choose a DC based on your assessment of the difficulty. You can also grant advantage (or lower the DC by 5) on the check if there's more than one set of of tracks to follow, or disadvantage (or higher the DC by 5) if the trail being followed passes through a well-trafficked area. 
On a failed check, the character loses the trail but can attempt to find it again by making a careful search of the area. It takes 10 minutes to fina a trail in a confined area such as a dungeon, or 1 hour in an open area or outdoors. 

If going at a slow pace there is a -5 penalty to the DC. If they are going fast there is a +5 bonus to the DC.
