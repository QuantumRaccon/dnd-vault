Name: Chorus Creeper 
Type: Aberration Size: Large CR: 10

Description: The Chorus Creeper is a horrifying, spider-like creature with a large, bulbous head resembling a distorted humanoid face. Its body is covered in a patchwork of ragged, chitinous plates, and its eight legs are elongated and end in sharpened, hook-like appendages. Its most unsettling feature is its ability to mimic the voices of those it has encountered or devoured, using these sounds to lure and confuse its prey.

Abilities:

1.  Echoing Mimicry: The Chorus Creeper can mimic any sound it has heard, including speech and the voices of specific individuals. It uses this ability to disorient and frighten its prey in the Echoing Caves, blending its own voice with the distorted echoes to create a cacophony of unsettling sounds.

2.  Horrific Visage: When a creature sees the Chorus Creeper's twisted, humanoid face for the first time, it must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself with a success.

3.  Multiattack: The Chorus Creeper can make three attacks: one with its bite and two with its claws.

4.  Bite: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 16 (2d10 + 5) piercing damage, and the target must make a DC 16 Constitution saving throw, taking 9 (2d8) poison damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.

5.  Claw: Melee Weapon Attack: +9 to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. Hit: 13 (2d8 + 4) slashing damage.

6.  Web (Recharge 5-6): Ranged Weapon Attack: +7 to hit, range 30/60 ft., one creature. Hit: The target is restrained by webbing. As an action, the restrained target can make a DC 16 Strength check, bursting the webbing on a success. The webbing can also be attacked and destroyed (AC 10, HP 10, vulnerability to fire damage, immunity to bludgeoning, poison, and psychic damage).
    
7.  Echolocation: The Chorus Creeper can't use its blindsight while deafened.
    
8.  Blindsight: 60 ft. (blind beyond this radius)
    
9.  Stealth: +6
