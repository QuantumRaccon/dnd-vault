- Towards the end of a day's march, travelers usually begin hunting about for a decent camp site. An ideal site has a number of good traits: a source of fuel for a fire, relative dryness, flat surfaces for sleeping on, limited approaches to the site, and a site that is tucked away out of general sight. Some may also have natural resources, such as water, food, herbs that aid in healing.
- Finding a camp takes an hour of travel, and is a Wisdom (Survival) test, at a DC based on the terrain.
    - If the group has more than one forager, use the best bonus, at advantage.

## Results

In a success roll on 3 traits in the Traits Table, roll again for the ones that repeat. For every 3 points above the DC scored in the test, make an additional roll. Failure indicates no site with any of these traits can be found.

## Fuel Source
---
Mushrooms and thick lichens grow nearby, with sufficient density to build and maintain a fire.

-  The patch can provide fire for 1d6 days before being exhausted.
-  A site without this trait cannot have a fire (which is necessary for recovering from cold-based exhaustion, Damp, or preparing food gained by hunting animals).
-   Otherwise, the group must bring their own fuel with which to build fires overnight.
-  The site's fuel can be harvested during the long rest by one individual, acquiring fuel that weighs 3lb per day's worth of fuel.

## Dry site
---
The site is dry enough to sleep and store gear at without danger of water damage or mildew.

-  A site without dryness accumulates 1d4 points of Damp. Some areas (those close to large bodies of water, for example) may generate higher dice values of Damp.
- Add the Damp rating cumulatively to a group's gear. At the end of each day's travel's everyone should make a check of 1d20 + current Damp rating. An 18+ results in losing 1d6 items to the creeping, insidious wet (a single person-day of food counts as 1 item for these purposes).
-  A long rest spent with a camp fire eliminates 2d6 Damp from the group's gear.
-  Trying to sleep in a damp area requires either a Constitution or Wisdom save, DC 12 + Damp generated. Failure on this check means the character gets no benefit from that long rest. This check is made at advantage if the character sleeps in a tent or similar shelter.
-  Finally, characters resting and traveling with active Damp may become ill.
	-  At the end of every day's travel while the group has a Damp rating, everyone must make a DC 8 + total Damp Constitution save.
	-  Failure results in illness. This illness immediately strips a hit die from the victim, which cannot be regained until the illness is defeated. This save is made every day, losing more and more hit dice as it progresses.
	-  An application of lesser restoration can cure it, as can a long rest spent with food beside a fire. As long as

## Sleeping Surfaces
---
The site has sufficient flat space for everyone to stretch out in while they rest.

- Lacking this forces a DC 13 Constitution or Wisdom save, attempting to sleep at odd angles, with sharp protrusions in the body, or in absurdly cramped space. Failure on this save means the character gets no benefit from that long rest. Characters with bedrolls may make this check at advantage.

## Limited Approaches
---
The location is not out in an open area; there are only 1d3 ways of approaching the site. Sites without this feature are open on most sides, and are vulnerable to attack from many sides.
-   A campsite with this feature grants advantage to the Wisdom (Perception) of those who are keeping an eye out for the approach of enemies.

## Sequestered
---
The camp site is difficult to notice for creatures passing by. Creatures that encounter it do not automatically detect the site; it is a DC of 10 + 1d6 to do so. If the site has a fire or lights lit, the passive Perception receives advantage.

## Water Source
---
There is a source of water nearby.

-   There is a 30% chance that it is a flowing, renewing water source like a spring, stream, or well, providing as much water as the party wishes to consume and carry away.
-   Otherwise, it is a more limited accumulation, in the form of drip pools, condensation wells, steam caches, or water orbs. It provides an opportunity to make a single Foraging test, providing water only.

## Food Source
---
There is a source of nourishment nearby.
-  There is a 40% chance it is animal-based; otherwise, it is plant-based.
-  As part of the long rest, someone may harvest this resource, making an additional Foraging test, providing food only.
-  Only one person may make this test, as it is a limited supply.

## Herbs
---
Medicinal herbs or mosses grow nearby. The fresh herbs may be used to make Medicine checks at advantage while on the site.

- A character with proficiency with herbalism kit may harvest and preserve the herbs to generate 2d6 "refills" for healer's kits in the party. This isn't enough to make a healer's kit from scratch, just to renew expended uses of existing kits.
