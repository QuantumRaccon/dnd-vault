#disease 

This malevolent disease is spread by myconids transormed by Zuggtmoy's Demonic influence (See "Myconids" in appendix C).  
A transformed myconid can release the spores in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a Constitution saving throw. The save DC is 8 + the myconid's Constitution Modifier + the myconid's proficency bonus. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and s reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual)
