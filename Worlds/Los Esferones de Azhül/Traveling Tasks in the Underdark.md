 -  A group may also employ a "counter-tracker" while they travel, having someone take the task of covering and concealing their tracks. This person must be in the back ranks of the marching order, and must make a Wisdom (Survival) test. This result becomes the DC for anyone attempting to track them. Performing this task while moving Fast is at disadvantage; moving at Slow pace grants advantage instead.

- [[Noticing Threats in the Underdark|Sentinel]]:Â Anyone not performing one of the above tasks is assumed to be keeping an eye out for trouble, applying their passive Perception to their surroundings. Some threats may only be spotted by those in specific parts of the marching order, generally the Front or Rear.
- Downtime activity
