Unless they obtain a supply of food and water, the adventurers mus forage to survive on their journey. Finding sustenance in the Underdark is difficult but not impossible. Characters can gather food and water if the party travels at a normal or slow pace. A foraging character makes a Wisdom (Survival) check. The DC is typically 15, but might be as high as 20 in some part of the Underdark. 

There is a +5 bonus for traveling at a slow pace.

- For each day of foraging, a character may make a Wisdom (Survival) check, with a DC based on the environment

| Food and Water Availability | DC  |
| --------------------------- | --- |
| Fungus Forests              | 10  |
| Openways                    | 18  |
| Stoneways                   | 15  |
| Forgeways                   | 20  |
| Deep Dark                   | 25    |

- Success on the check allows a single roll on the Foraging Table
	- For each 5 full points above the DC, the foraging character may make another roll on the Foraging Table

- Multiple characters may make foraging checks during travel.

## Fungi Table

Identifying a species of fungi anti its potential uses requires a successful DC 15 intelligence (Nature) check but Underdark inhabitants are familiar with many of these species automatically.

# Food

A character needs one pound of food per day and can make food last longer by subsisting on half rations. Eating half a pound of food in a day counts as half a day without food.

A character can go without food for a number of days equal to 3 + his or her Constitution modifier (minimum 1). At the end of each day beyond that limit, a character automatically suffers one level of [[exhaustion]].

A normal day of eating resets the count of days without food to zero.


# Water

A character needs one gallon of water per day, or two gallons per day if the weather is hot. A character who drinks only half that much water must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of exhaustion at the end of the day. A character with access to even less water automatically suffers one level of exhaustion at the end of the day.

If the character already has one or more levels of [[exhaustion]], the character takes two levels in either case.
