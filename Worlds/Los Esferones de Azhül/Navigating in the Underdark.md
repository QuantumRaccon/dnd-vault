Unless they are following a path, track, or something like it, adventurers traveling in the underdark (or wilderness) run the risk of becoming lost.

Becoming lost is a serious risk in the twisting tunnels of the Underdark, and travelers can wander in circles without knowing it. 

There are three elements that make navigation possible in the Underdark. Having at least one allows the character to make a Navigation check at disadvantage. Two permits a normal check, and three grants checks at advantage.

- **Familiarity:** A character familiar with an area can be of tremendous benefit towards getting around in it. Moreover, this person doesn't have to be the navigator, although their traveling task does become aiding the navigator.
- **Maps:** A good set of maps for Underdark travel generally covers routes rather than broad swathes of terrain.
- **Navigator's Tools:** Though a normal set of navigator's tools is insufficient for delving through the Underdark wildernesses, most settled areas of the Underdark do sell navigator's tools for Underdark travel. Using it is the same proficiency as navigator's tools.
- **Assistance:** A navigator who has assistance from someone with one of the three above elements can gain advantage on the check in question.

A creature not having any of the elements above is automatically lost, wandering in a a random direction for every 1d6 hours of travel until they encounter an area they are familiar with (which could be very long time)

## Navigation Checks
---
- A Navigation check is made when a group starts traveling again after each long rest, short rest, or encounter (if it makes sense)
- The check itself is a Wisdom (Survival) check.
- If the party is moving at a slow pace, the navigator gain a +5 bonus, while a fast pace imposes a -5 penalty
- The DC for this test is based on the area in question. Generally if its and Openway the DC is 10, for more complicated places the DC can be higher.

## Navigation Results
---
- Success on this check results in travel through the area without getting lost.
	- Achieving a result +5 higher than the DC allows passage through a rout that "eats up" an additional 1d4 hours from the time to reach the destination. 
- Failure on this test results in the party getting lost.
	- Lost characters wander through the tunnels, caverns, and byways of their location for 1d6 hours. (This can trigger and encounter)
	- At the end of this time, the Navigator of the party may make another Navigation check.
	- Three failed checks in a row results in the party ending up in a location that none of them are familiar with, and that is off of any of their maps. 

# Time-Keeping
---
With no sunlight, visible sky, seasons, or weather in the Underdark, most characters can only track the passage of time based on their periods of rest. Most Underdark creatures do the same (If they care about timekeeping at all), unless there is a local means of keeping time.
