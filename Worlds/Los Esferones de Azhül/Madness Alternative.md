Replacing short-term madness effects from the DMG, characters are subjected to the rolled effect for 1d10 minutes.

| d100   | Effect (lasts 1d10 minutes)                                                                                                                                                    |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-20  | The character is rooted in place; their move speed becomes 0. This effect ends if the character takes damage or if another character spends an action to shake them out of it. |
| 21-35  | The character is disoriented and cannot take any actions outside of movement.                                                                                                  |
| 36-45  | The character is significantly emotionally distressed, taking disadvantage on all Charisma based skill checks and saving throws                                                |
| 46-55  | The character becomes nervous and starts trembling, taking disadvantage on Sleight of Hand checks and all ranged attacks                                                       |
| 56-65  | The character's confidence is shaken, has disadvantage on Athletics checks, Acrobatics checks, and all melee attacks.                                                          |
| 66-75  | The character's fear becomes hesitation, and they take a 1d4 penalty to all ability checks and attack rolls.                                                                   |
| 76-85  | The character is dazed and substracts 10 from their passive Wisdom (Perception and Insight) and cannot make Perception or Insight checks.                                      |
| 86-95  | The character becomes frightened and must use their movement each round to flee from the source of the fear.                                                                   |
| 96-100 | The character faints, falling unconscious.                                                                                                                                     |


# Major Trauma
---
Replacing long-term madness effects from the DMG, characters are subjected to the rolled effect for 1d10 x 10 hours.

| d100   | Effect (lasts 1d10 x 10 hours)                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 01-20  | The character is deeply rattled and can speak only falteringly, imposing disadvantage on any spell-related rolls for spells that require verbal component.                                                    |
| 21-35  | The character suffers frequent trembling which imposes disadvantage on attack rolls and saving throws using Strength or Dexterity.                                                                            |
| 36-45  | The character is badly shaken, and has disadvantage on all ability checks.                                                                                                                                    |
| 46-55  | The character is unsettled enough to experience issues with focus and memory recall. They may not make any intelligence based skill checks.                                                                   |
| 56-65  | The character becomes paranoid and fearful of what may lurk in the shadows. When not in bright light, all ability checks and attack rolls are made at disadvantage                                            |
| 66-75  | The character has become fatigued in response to their trauma, and their speed is halved.                                                                                                                     |
| 76-85  | The character prefers for daydream rather than think about the trauma that has affected them. At the start of combat, the character must roll a Wisdom saving throw (DC 13), becoming surprised on a failure. |
| 86-95  | The character regards something related to the source of their trauma with intense revulsion, as it affected by the antipathy effect of the [[Antipathy Sympathy]] spell.                                     |
| 96-100 | The character falls unconscious. They cannot be roused from their fitful sleep until the trauma effect ends, is cured, or until they have taken enough damage to go below 0 hit points, at which point they may wake as normal upon stabilization or successful death saves.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |


# Persistent Trauma
---
Replacing indefinite madness effects. These effects are to be noted under the *Flaws* section on a character's sheet, as they are permanent until magically cured, or they are treated properly. Effects in quotation marks should be directly copied onto a character's sheet; other effects should be relayed to the player to note down as they see fit, and their effects should be kept track of by both the DM and the player

| d100   | Effects (lasts until cured)                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 01-15  | You suffer from night terrors. On a long rest, you must roll a d6; on a 1, you do not gain the benefits of a long rest. You may instead roll hit dice as if taking a short rest. You recover spent spell slots and may prepare new spells. |
| 16-30  | “I have overcorrected for my shaken confidence and now view myself with elevated self worth and forced bravado ”                                                                                                                           |
| 31-40  | “I have significant difficulty letting go of or discarding things that may be important, no matter how insignificant other might consider them ”                                                                                           |
| 41-50  | “I am extremely protective of those around me and worry constantly about the safety of my companions, likely to the point of annoyance at my fretting.”                                                                                    |
| 51-60  | Your patience with others has worn somewhat thin. You have advantage on Intimidation and Deception checks, but disadvantage on all other Charisma-based checks, including saving throws.                                                   |
| 61-70  | “I am hyper-aware of how others view me, and am desperate for approval and praise to help me cope with my shaken confidence.”                                                                                                              |
| 71-80  | “I try to keep mementos of who or what I’ve lost, no matter how odd, and become upset or enraged if someone suggests parting with them or tries to take them from me.”                                                                     |
| 81-90  | “I am reluctant to admit when I don’t know something, fearing the judgment of others. I sometimes jump to make assumptions in an attempt to fill the gaps in my knowledge.”                                                                |
| 91-100 | Your trauma has caused you to lose interest in something you were once passionate about. You are no longer proficient in a skill of your DM’s choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |


# Persistent Trauma Variant: Environmental Stres
---
This alternate table is to be substituted at the DM’s discretion in places that might additionally magically affect or corrupt characters in ways resembling persistent trauma effects (alongside the possibility of more mundane effects), such as faerzress-suffused areas of the Underdark, or the Demiplane of Dread.


| d100   | Effects (lasts until cured)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

| 01-15  | You suffer from night terrors. On a long rest, you must roll a d6; on a 1, you do not gain the benefits of a long rest. You may instead roll hit dice as if taking a short rest. You recover spent spell slots and may prepare new spells.                                                                                                               |
| 16-30  | “I often doubt aspects of my surroundings and am hypervigilant of anything that I think may not entirely be as it seems. I might believe that a ‘suspiciously empty-looking’ clearing likely contains invisible enemies, or that every chest, door, or doorframe I encounter is a mimic.”                                                                |
| 31-40  | You have developed a significant fear of—or intense disgust or hatred for—some aspect of your surroundings at the time this stress took effect: for example, a type of beast. or a weather effect present at the time.                                                                                                                                   |
| 41-50  | “I no longer feel safe alone, and strongly prefer to be within 100 feet of others at all times.”                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 51-60  | “Whenever I hear of prophecies, omens, or similar such things, I assume they must be about me or my companions. After all, my situation has been strange enough already that it would be far stranger for them not to concern me. Even the prophecies of the past are not out of the question—after all, chronomancy exists.”                            |
| 61-70  | “The stress of my situation tends to cause me to lash out at others. Though I likely regret my actions later, in the moment, I am often obstinate and unwavering in my frustration.”                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 71-80  | “I have come to believe the gods are testing me and using me for entertainment, possibly even controlling my every move in a dice game. I might sometimes make sarcastic verbal asides to the gods I know must be watching me, or perhaps I carefully choose my words or actions in order to consciously manipulate the narrative I’ve found myself in.” |
| 81-90  | “I have developed a mild to moderate fear of the passage of time and/or dread growing older. This often leads to impatience, as every second that passes is a second lost forever.”                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 91-100 | Your experiences have caused you to lose interest in something you were once passionate about. You are no longer proficient in a skill of your DM’s choice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |


# Persistent Trauma Variant: Abyssal Corruption
---
This alternate table is to be used in circumstances wherein a character has a chance to become magically corrupted or else subject to any kind of magical curse that might resemble a persistent trauma effect, alongside the possibility of more mundane trauma—namely, the circumstances of failing a save versus persistent trauma in the presence of a Demon Lord from the Abyss, although the table may be used for other similar scenarios.

---
