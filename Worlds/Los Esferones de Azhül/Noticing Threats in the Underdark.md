# Noticing Threats (Being Alert)

Every character not performing some other function is assumed to be keeping an eye out in the environment as they travel. This allows them to apply their passive Perception to possibly notice traps, hazards, and encounters.

The passive Perception scores of characters in the party count toward noticing hidden threats only if both the following conditions are met:

- The characters are able to see the threat (due to illumination or darkvision)
- The characters aren't engaged in other activities, including navigating or foraging.

A fast pace imposes a -5 penalty to passive perception score to notice threats. You might also decide that only characters in a a particular rank of the marching order are able to notice a specific threat. 

Front rank can notice hidden threats in front of group and sides. Middle rank can notice hidden threats at sides and back rank can notice hidden threats behind and to the sides.

**Checks Required**: Foes/threats must overcome Passive Perception of characters being alert.

**Optional**: Characters performing tasks have a chance of noticing things, although it is greatly reduced: apply disadvantage to their passive Perception.


# Noticing threats (Stealthy)

Only possible at **slow pace** and in **non-open** terrain. Similar to Noticing threats plus moving stealthily (silently and hiding) in non open terrain. Can surprise foes

**Checks Required**: Dexterity (stealth) check that exceeds foe Passive Perception to surprise foe

**Optional**: Its hard for a vehicle to be stealthy, this option can't be taken generally if the party moves in a vehicle. 

## Surprise

When an encounter occurs, determine if the adventurers or their foes are surprised, as normal. The adventurers can achieve surprise only if all the following conditions are met: 

- The encounter occurs while the party is moving (not stopped or camped)
- The party elected the stealth option while moving at a slow pace. And stealth is possible for the terrain in question. 
- At least one part member is capable of noticing the threat and communicating it to the rest of the group
