![[Timmask.webp]]
Also known as *the devil's mushroom* a timmask is a two-foot-tall toadstool with orange and red stripes across its beige cap. Uprooting or destroying a timmask causes it to expel a 15-foot-radius of poisonous spores. Creatures in the area must succeed at a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or be [[Poisoned]]. While poisoned in this way, the creature is under the effect of a [[Confusion]] spell with a duration of 1 minute. When the spell ends, the poisoned condition also ends.
