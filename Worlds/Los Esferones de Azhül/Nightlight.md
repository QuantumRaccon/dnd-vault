![[Nightlight.webp]]

A nightlight is a tall and tube-shaped bioluminescent mushroom that grows to height of 1d6+4 feet and emits bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 15 feet. A nightlight that is uprooted or destroyed goes dark after 1 round. If a living nightlight is touched, either by a creature or an object, its light goes out until it is touched again.
