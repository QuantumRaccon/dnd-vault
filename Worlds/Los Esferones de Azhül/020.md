>[! Note] Zuggtmoy's Gift
> A myconid with Zuggtmoy's gift can, as an action once per day, release a 20-foot-radius cloud of demon-tainted spores. Any other creature within the area that isn't already "blessed" with Zuggtmoy's gift must make a Constitution saving throw, with a DC of 8 + the myconid's Constitution Modifier + the myconid's proficency bonus. A creature that forgoes or fails the saving throw becomes infected. While infected with Zuggtmoy's gift, the creature gains the ability to cast a special version of the [[Tree Stride]] Spell that has no components. This spell allows the infected creature to move through patches of mold and fungi instead of trees. Once it casts this spell, the infected creature can't cast the spell again until it finishes a long rest. 
> Any creature infected with Zuggtmoy's gift has disadvantage on attacks rolls against plan creatures. In addition, whenever an infected creature finishes a short or long rest, it must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature lapses into a state of euphoric bliss. While in this state, the creature can't take actions, bonus actions, or reactions, and must use all of its movement to dance and twirl about. At the end of its turn, the creature can repeat the saving throw, ending the euphoric bliss effect on a success. A [[Remove Curse]] or [[Greater Restoration]] spell rids a creature of Zuggtmoy's Gift.

>[!Note] Zuggtmoy's Spores
>This malevolent disease is spread by myconids transormed by Zuggtmoy's Demonic influence (See "Myconids" in appendix C).
>A transformed myconid can release the spores in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a Constitution saving throw. The save DC is 8 + the myconid's Constitution Modifier + the myconid's proficency bonus. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of Zuggtmoy table in appendix D) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and s reanimated as a spore servant if it's a type of creature that can be (see the "Myconids" entry in the Monster Manual)
