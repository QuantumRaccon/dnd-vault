A character not focused on any other task —including watching for danger while traveling— can record the group's progress through the Underdark and create a map of the route. Such map can be useful resource in later moments when characters retrace their steps. 

- During days of travel, the mapper is assumed to be recording the paths the group travels through. 
- If the mapper has proficiency with [[Cartographer's Tools]], this happens automatically, as long as they have the tool kit. 
- If the mapper does not, they must make a daily DC 12 Intelligence test. Success provides a normal map; a failure should be recorded. Upon accruing three failures on this test, a map is too flawed to be successfully used for navigation. 
- **Copying Maps**: Copying a map takes one hour per day of the route in question. 
	- Someone proficient with cartographer's tools can make an Intelligence (Cartographer's tools) test, DC 14 to reduce this time in half.

## Selling Maps

-   **Finding Buyers:** Cartographers, merchants, pilgrims, and even folk needing to travel from one place to another may all have cause to purchase a map.
    -   It takes a day's effort and a DC 14 Charisma check to find buyers. This DC increases by +3 for every additional day of searching for purchasers.
    -   Success results in finding 1d4 + Charisma modifier number of interested buyers.
    -   Failure indicates there is no further interest in the map specifically.
-   **Price:** The base price of a map is a number of gold pieces equal to the number of days on the route. This may be multiplied by 2 for routes through wild areas, 5 for routes through particularly dangerous or untraveled areas, and by .5 for maps of routes through well-traveled areas.
    -   Haggling for the sale of that map is handled through normal haggling rules.
