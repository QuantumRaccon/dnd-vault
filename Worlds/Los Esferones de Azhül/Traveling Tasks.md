 -  A group may also employ a "counter-tracker" while they travel, having someone take the task of covering and concealing their tracks. This person must be in the back ranks of the marching order, and must make a Wisdom (Survival) test. This result becomes the DC for anyone attempting to track them. Performing this task while moving Fast is at disadvantage; moving at Slow pace grants advantage instead.
