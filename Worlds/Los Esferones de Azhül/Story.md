Leena, a poised and enigmatic woman, was the proprietor of a quaint tavern in the bustling city of Ardamos, a hub populated predominantly by humans. Unknown to many, beneath this city's labyrinthine streets, resided Hanso, an artificer of the near-extinct Velkot race. This underground lair harbored an ancient, powerful artifact known as the Spheron of Mysto, which Hanso zealously guarded.

The Spheron of Mysto was no ordinary relic; it was a pulsating sphere imbued with an astonishing power that demanded submersion in water to prevent it from becoming unstable. Hanso, with his ashen, decaying skin resembling the cursed rot of his kin, was a vestige of the Velkot civilization. The Velkots, despite their highly advanced culture and extensive knowledge of the arcane, remained shrouded in mystery. Legend held that their society was cursed by the gods, causing their flesh to decay. They sought countless remedies and even attempted consciousness transference, but nothing halted their demise.

The Velkots didn’t create the Spherons; rather, they discovered them. There were four such Spherons, said to be not of this world. Each contained an ancient elemental deity older than the gods themselves. Their origins, and who imprisoned these primordial beings within, remained a mystery. Fearing that the Spherons could fall into malevolent hands, the Velkots went to great lengths to protect them.

One such dark force that sought the Spherons was the Order of Kyros, led by the formidable Kyros, a servant of the Demon Lord Orcus. Their sinister ambition was to harness the Spherons’ power to reshape the world in their malevolent image.

Hanso's connection to Ardamos was through Leena, who was unaware of her true lineage. Her real name was Nia, and she was discovered as an infant in an underwater temple during an expedition led by Hanso and her adoptive parents, renowned scholars. Alongside her, the Water Spheron was also found. Unbeknownst to her, Leena was not human. Her true form was that of an ancient being, a child of creation. She harbored an innate Spheron within her, which could channel immense arcane power.

Hanso, who had been close friends with Leena's adoptive parents, helped her escape to Ardamos after they disappeared on an ill-fated expedition. He had the uncanny ability to disguise himself as a human, hence Leena never knew his true Velkot form. Their paths crossed often, though she remained unaware of their shared history.

One fateful day, Hanso was ill-treated by patrons at Leena's tavern. In a fit of rage, he unwittingly unleashed the power of the Spheron. The ensuing surge of arcane energy reverberated through the realms, alerting the Order of Kyros.

Within a month, the Order descended upon Ardamos, leaving it in ashes. Leena, with her friend Greta, met Hanso amidst the chaos. They fled with the Spheron safely encased in a watertight vessel.

Their escape led them into a dark cave, inhabited by Stalkers - eerie, blind creatures with elongated limbs. Following a harrowing encounter, Hanso cast a spell that caused a cave-in, separating him from Leena and Greta, who found themselves in a serene Myconid Grove. Here, they encountered Fim, a kind Myconid. Greta was hurt because a slime attacked her on the upper caves, she was unconcis and was left to taken care of by Fim.

Leena, resolved to find Hanso, ventured through the Myst Forest where she stumbled upon a crystal-laden cavern. These were Solar Crystals, radiant with ancient magic. Upon contact, the Spheron within Leena absorbed the crystals’ energy, sending her into a trance. She communed with Girt, an ascended mage, who revealed the peculiar locations of Solar Crystals - near the sun and in the depths of the earth.

As Leena awakened, she pressed on, her path leading her to the edge of the Rift - an abyssal chasm shrouded in darkness and throbbing with an eldritch energy, she pressed on illuminated by the soft luminescence of Flint, her shape-shifting familiar, peered into the depths of the Rift, she felt an ancient energy envelop her. The Underdark, notorious for its ominous shadows, seemed to cradle her as if recognizing a kindred spirit. Her heart pulsed with anticipation as she discovered remnants of an ancient civilization - their architecture bearing an uncanny resemblance to the underwater temple where she was found as an infant.

The Rift itself seemed like a sentient abyss, its colossal chains, as dark as the void, stretching across the chasm like binding shackles. Leena, testing the depth of the Rift, watched as pebbles she dropped into it vanished silently. A sense of déjà vu enveloped her as the layout of the ruins and the Rift appeared to defy the laws of space, looping her back to where she began.

Driven by an ineffable yearning, Leena pressed forward. After what felt like an eternity, she spotted an eerie glow in the distance. The flickering lights emanated from an imposing walled city, its perimeter aglow with ethereal, green flames atop brass sconces reminiscent of the ancient cauldrons.

The gateway to the city was a monolithic structure, adorned with inscriptions that eluded her understanding. Summoning the magic within her, she cast ‘Comprehend Languages’ and deciphered the text: "Only Gabriel's Horn shall tumble such gates of Hell itself."

Undeterred, Leena used ‘Misty Step’ to phase through the gates. Inside, the city seemed abandoned, but an unnerving sensation of being watched persisted. The air was heavy with whispers of countless aeons past.

It was here that she encountered Lucilius, a figure enshrouded in shadows, his face concealed behind an ancient mask. His voice, deep and resonant, filled the empty city as he spoke with palpable disapproval. "This sanctuary is a tomb for the fallen, a place that time has forsaken. You tread on hallowed ground," he admonished.

Lucilius, the guardian of this lost city, revealed that this place was once a nexus of knowledge and power, where beings from different realms converged. However, it fell into ruin following a cataclysmic event, and now served as a resting place for those who sacrificed themselves to protect the multiverse.
