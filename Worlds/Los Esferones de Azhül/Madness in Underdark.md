At best of times, the Underdark is a bizarre, alien, and inhospitable world.

Catalysts: 
- The characters encounter or witness something particularly alien or disturbing
- The characters stay in [[faerzress]]-suffed area for a eight or more consecutive hours.
- A character takes psychic damage, particularly in an area suffused with faerzress.

In Out of the Abyss madness is measured in three levels: 

| Level | Effect                                            |     
| ----- | ------------------------------------------------- | 
| 1     | Bout of short-term madness (lasts 1d10 min)       |     
| 2     | Bout of long-term madness (lasts 1d10 x 10 hours) |     
| 3     | Bout of indefinite madness (lasts until cured)    |    

A creature's madness level starts at 0. When the creature fails a madness saving throw, its madness level increases by, and the creature suffers the level's effect. 

When the effect ends, the creature's madness level doesn't change. Any time the creature's madness level increases, it suffers the effect of the new level.
If a creature with level 3 madness fails a madness saving throw, its madness level becomes 1. In this way, characters can potentially accumulate multiple forms of madness. 

Bouts of short- and long-term madness can be cured as described in DMG. Given the demonic source, remove curse and dispel evil also work. A greater restoration spell or more powerful magic is needed to cure indefinite madness and also resets a creature's madness level to 0. 

Many factors can contribute such that a level of madness can be gained. If the character is engaged in relaxing activities it can withstand with better chance that his level of madness increases in a trigger situation.
