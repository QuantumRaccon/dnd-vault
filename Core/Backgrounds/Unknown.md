Your background is unknown to you because you suffered some trauma that has inflicted you with amnesia. You woke one day, not knowing who you are or how you got here. Your origin and family are a mystery to you. You are not sure if you have allies or enemies from your past. If you have skills beyond what your class training details, you struggle to recall them.

Who looked after you while you recuperated? Were your class skills taught to you after your trauma, or are you slowly recalling them from your past? Do you have flashbacks or dreams hinting at your ordeal?


- **Proficiencies and Languages**: _Special._ Whenever you attempt a skill, use a tool or try to comprehend a language you are not already proficient with, roll a **d20**. On a natural 20, you have recalled one of your pre-trauma talents and gain that proficiency; otherwise you must finish a long rest before you can make this check for the same proficiency again. Once you have recalled five proficiencies with this feature, you no longer make this check.
- **Equipment**: Just the clothes on your back, 1 gp in your boot.


**_Feature: Gradual Recall_**. Each time you meet a new NPC or visit a new location, once per character level, you can decide that they feel familiar. This place or person is somehow related to your life leading up to the trauma that caused your amnesia. This will not divulge much information, but will provide some further clue. You should work with your DM to fit this new element into your background, aiming to give full disclosure by the middle of the third tier.

- Level 1–4:

- The NPC incidentally recognizes you but doesn't know you. They remember you performing some act, such as speaking to a mysterious figure (and overhearing a few words), buying an item from a store, or being involved in a fight.
- Locations might be places you visited but once, or passed through on your way to somewhere else.





- Level 5–8:

- The NPC knows you only by a nom de guerre and a little about what happened to you, but is evasive in giving you information. If forced to speak, they give only one clue before circumstances end the interrogation (he simply escapes, or he's in a position of power, or a vicious storm rocks the boat...)
- Locations might be taverns or dungeons that you frequented.





- Level 9–12:

- The NPC was directly involved with your trauma, and knows your real identity. Some conflict must be resolved before their relationship to you is fully understood: this could be a combat encounter or fulfilling a request made by them.
- A location might be your family home, your place of work, your secret hideout, or some other place very personal to you that will reveal your identity through investigation.




This feature may drag you into involvement with secret societies, nobility, evil armies, hidden temples, and other intrigues. Once you have total recall about your life and your trauma, one of these story elements can be used to create a new background feature to replace Gradual Recall.

**_Clue_**. When you woke as an amnesiac, you discovered one thing about yourself that could provide a clue as to what happened to you.
