You worked for (or were raised by) an organization which specialized in tracking, investigating, and apprehending beings that had magical powers. Perhaps your organization was a school of wizards and sorcerers that had a distaste for students who practice magic outside their teachings, or for a government that had a hatred of those who dabble in the dark arts. You enforced the rules of magic - whether for a public or private interest. Work with your DM to determine what organization you were a part of and the reason you left. Perhaps you accidentally killed an innocent civilian that wasn't a magic practitioner at all, maybe you were forced into retirement, or maybe you discovered that your organization's intentions were corrupt and evil.

If you prefer a less foundational backstory, maybe you were the sole survivor of a horrific magical event which hardened your heart against magic and all its users. You strive to destroy magic and those who use it, seeing it as a force none ought to wield due to its destructive potential. Work with your DM to discuss what possible historical event or recurring phenomena involving magic could have tempered a hatred towards the arcane. Perhaps your home was ransacked by an infamous band of bloodthirsty wizards, or maybe someone dear to you was used as a sacrifice in the name of magical research.


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Arcana]], [[Investigation]]

- **Equipment**: A set of [[traveler's clothes]], a pocket book entitled _Field Guide To Auras, Nodes and Residuals_, a quill,  5 parchments, and a [[pouch]] containing 10 gp.


**_Feature: Reputation_**. Your occupation has gained you infamy across the magical community whether you like it or not. All mages you encounter now believe talking to you implicates them as a target of your organization. When you are in a civilized settlement, you can invoke your position to exert influence over mages to gain information. This might include secret hideouts, meetings, pieces of lore, locations of dark artifacts, or the whereabouts of someone you might be searching for.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Mage hunters are shaped by their organization's goals, beliefs, and traditions. The tolls of hunting mages whether you believed they were innocent or not have left a mark on you, forming most of your characteristics.
