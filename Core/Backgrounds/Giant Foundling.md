|d6|Personality Trait|
|---|-------------|
|1|What I lack in stature, I make up for with sheer spite.|
|2|Sometimes size does matter, okay? If I see a beast bigger than me, I'm immediately running away.|
|3|Crowded spaces make me uncomfortable. I'd much rather be in a wide-open field than a bustling tavern.|
|4|I like being small. It helps me stay unnoticedâ€”and underestimated.|
|5|Size is just half the story. Every avalanche begins as a single pebble.|
|6|The world always feels too big, and I'm afraid I'll never find my place in it.|
