You once were a chef, the king of food. Either you were an artisan chef with a fine sense of taste, a master chef who knows dozens on dozens of recipes by heart, or a cook at the mess hall, serving food quickly and on the double. You understand that food has a voice; it can express moods with the right combinations of ingredients, or bring people together with a peaceful meal. What brought you out of the kitchen? A rare ingredient? Maybe your upper chef decided it was time for you to go? Or, maybe, you wanted to go on an adventure to diversify your recipe book? Regardless on why you decided to change pace from your culinary solitude, your cooking and food handling skills will prove vital to an adventuring party. You may even find food where most people don't!


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Insight]], [[Performance]]
- **Tool Proficiencies**: [[Cook's Utensils]]
- **Languages**: 2 languages of your choice, from which you derive your culinary terminology and techniques.
- **Equipment**: A [[mess kit]], a set of [[cook's utensils]], a [[glass bottle \|bottle]] of cooking [[oil (flask) \|oil]], a [[Heward's Handy Spice Pouch \|spice kit]], several recipe [[book \|books]], a [[tinderbox]], an [[iron pot]], your choice of [[costume clothes \|costume]] or [[fine clothes]], an electrum spork or plans for kitchensmith tools, and a belt pouch containing 5gp.


**_Feature: A Tasteful Sentiment_**. You can use food to communicate more than just good flavor; you can produce intellectually meaningful dishes which can send a message, however simple and abstract. At the DM's discretion, (preferably based on how the player describes what they do to send a message) you can be [[Persuasion]], [[Deception]], and even [[Intimidation]] attempts by simply feeding a person a meal, or by preparing it in front of them. You may also treat public preparation of food as a [[Performance]] to entertain.
For example, in an attempt to  a peace between two nations, you may prepare a dish which incorporates both cultures' cuisines in a creative and enjoyable way and then serve it to the negotiation delegates.
An example of an  meal would be one designed to appear poisonous, made from the target's fallen allies, or decorated with unpleasant symbolism, like a union jack cake served to a colonial American minuteman.
Examples of food preparation as a  would include juggling/tossing of ingredients, fancy knife work, preparation of _flambé_, and other visually entertaining techniques.
 Generally, this means that they should be allowed to add their tool proficiency to the check, even if they lack the typical skill proficiency, but it's really up to you whether it counts and when. The whole intent of this feature is for you and the player to work together to incorporate their background into play by rewarding its creative application, not to give the player four skill proficiencies for all situations, or to give you a method of wiping out the value of their roleplaying feature. Don't be a pushover OR a jerk about it.

**_Brigade de Cuisine_**. _Brigade de cuisine_ (kitchen brigade in Common) is a system of hierarchy found in restaurants and hotels employing extensive staff, commonly referred to as "kitchen staff" in Common-speaking countries. This structured team system delegates responsibilities to different individuals who specialize in certain tasks. You can alter these titles to suit your language choice for this background.
|**d6**|Specialization|
|---|-------------|
|1| Manages the kitchen and its staff. The _Chef de Cuisine_ is typically authorised to write and alter the menu, while a _sous chef_ is just a manager.|
|2| Manages a portion of the kitchen staff if the team is very large. Examples include _Rôtisseur_ (roast cook), _Entremetier_ (entrée preparer), and _Pâtissier_ (pastry cook). If they do the work themselves, they are called a _demi-chef_.|
|3| An cook in an independent position which requires no team or division of oversight, so are generally superior to _cuisiniers de parti_, but subordinate to all _chefs_. Examples include _Saucier_ (saucemaker), _Poissonnier_ (fishcook), _Boucher_ (butcher), and _Communard_ (Kitchen staff meal cook).|
|4 A subordinate to a chef in a particular area of the kitchen:

- The _Grillardin_ (grill cook) and _Friturier_ (fry cook) answer to the _Rôtisseur_.
- The _Potager_ (soup cook) and _Legumier_ (vegetable cook) answer to the _Entremetier_.
- The _Confiseur_ (candy maker), _Glacier_ (frozen desert maker), _Décorateur_ (dessert decorator), and _Boulanger_ (baker) answer to the _Pâtissier_.


|
|5| Generally an assistant, they look after the cooking equipment, not the food. A successful apprentice becomes a _commis_, who eventually takes on higher responsibilities.|
|6| These positions deal with other tasks around the kitchen, and include the _Garde Manger_ (pantry supervisor), _Aboyeur_ (announcer/expediter), _Tournant_ (spare hand/roundsman), _Garçon de cuisine_ (kitchen boy), and _Plongeur/Marmiton_ or _Porter_ (dish/pot washer). All of these positions are known to be enlisted to do basic/menial food preparation.|


**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Chefs vary widely in temperaments. As professionals, they can be fickle and perfectionists who run their team ragged. However, they are also dedicated to their vocation and skill to ultimately fill up bellies and provide hospitality.
