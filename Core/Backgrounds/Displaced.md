You don't belong in this world. You come from an alien realm where magic doesn't exist, technology is far more advanced, and the adventures you now face are confined only to fiction.

Consider how long you have been in this world, and how you managed to procure the powers associated with your class. Have you been stuck here for years, learning the ways of this world as a means to survive? Did you appear not only in an unfamiliar place, but an unfamiliar body? Think about your previous life, what skills you have, and how you apply these to your new life.


- **Skill Proficiencies**: Any two skills that are not Arcana, History, or Religion
- **Tool Proficiencies**: Two of your choice from any artisan's tools (except alchemist's supplies), any musical instrument, or any gaming set
- **Equipment**: A communications device with no power, a wallet with a dozen banknotes of a currency not accepted in this world, a ring of keys, a set of strange clothes, and a pouch with 10 gp


**_Feature: Modern Knowledge_**. Though you came to this world without a copper piece to your name, the advanced knowledge you brought with you has given you something of value to offer. You are well versed in a field that is farther advanced in your world than the one you are in now. You could be well educated, but even a basic education in some places of your world is extraordinary in this one.
To make a life for yourself, you have contributed your knowledge to some organization in this world. You may have taught a cult the secrets of calculus, or instructed a blacksmith's guild in how to make stronger steel. The organization considers itself indebted to you for your contribution, and is willing to support you at a modest lifestyle. They consider you a member of their organization, although you may have to pay monthly dues to gain the full benefits of membership. The technology you introduce may cause disruption in the world and its balance of power. Work with your DM to determine what impact your knowledge has on the world, if any.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Displaced characters are strangers in a strange land. They might see this as a call to action to become a hero like in the stories they grew up with, or they may only care about making it out alive. In any case, they are defined by a culture that those around them can't come close to relating to.
