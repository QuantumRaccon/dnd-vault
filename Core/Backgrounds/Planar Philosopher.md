**_Building a Planar Philosopher Character_**. Some groups of planar philosophers might have preferences for or against certain types of characters, but by and large any character that upholds and furthers the beliefs of the group is welcome within its ranks.

The Planar Philosopher Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character, and which factions would welcome adventurers with those traits.
