You have spent your life in service of preparing, interring, and protecting the dead. You tend to the dead, preparing corpses in a manner in keeping with your craft and preferred by the family of the deceased. The handling of the dead is taboo in many societies, so the undertaker's role is to do what others would not - many find themselves shunned by the people they serve. Though undertakers may be ridiculed and ignored, they are a necessary part of their communities.


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Medicine]], [[Religion]]
- **Tool Proficiencies**: [[Disguise Kit]]
- **Languages**: One of your choice
- **Equipment**: A holy symbol (a gift to you when you became an undertaker), a hammer, a set of fine clothes, a small knife, a vial of perfume, a needle, thread, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp.


**_Feature: Respect for the Dead_**. While most are repulsed by or shy away from it, you have made your living handling the dead. You are familiar with the religious rites, funerary services, and corpse treatments of most societies. Your experience often results in you having unquestioned access to unsavory places, such as crime-scenes, morgues, and cemeteries. In addition, due to the unpleasant nature of your trade you are less likely to attract scorn for possession of corpses, bones, and other normally taboo items.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. An undertaker is defined by the place held in their community and the expertise of their craft.
