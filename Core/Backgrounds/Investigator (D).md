You have dedicated your life to pursuit, revelation, and apprehension. Your training has taught you how to determine the truth of a matter through steady analysis and firm inquiry.

As an investigator, determine how you apply your skills in the world. Do you work for the government, an organization, a private business, or do you operate your own enterprise? What caused you to take up the broader mantle of an adventurer?


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Investigation]], and one from [[Insight]] or [[Perception]]
- **Tool Proficiencies**: One type of [[gaming set]]
- **Languages**: One of your choice
- **Equipment**:  A set of common clothes, a traveling longcoat. official detective's documents, a piece of evidence or memento from a cold case, a notebook, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp


**_Feature: Investigator's Declaration_**. As an investigator you may declare your profession, identifying yourself as one who is determined to ascertain truth. When proclaimed this can give a civilized creature pause, encourage them to flee, or cause them to be more willing to talk to you. This declaration may be accompanied by an official sigil which permits you to operate within the bounds of your government or organization, or your very disassociation with greater authorities may curry favor with creatures you converse with.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. An investigator who takes up the life of an adventurer expands their sphere of concern to the greater world, but still applies an investigative ethos in their travels.
