You understand wealth, power, and privilege - you just never had any of it yourself. Those with noble titles, merchant empires, and large castles need people to take care of their day-to-day affairs, and you know that life well.

You lived -or liveâ€”your life in service to a family of middle or higher class. You are more familiar than most with the ins, outs, and back roads of the upper crust of society. Interacting with the rich and powerful has taught you much about their world and given you some keen and humble insights into human nature.

Work with your DM to determine your place of service in the world and the master who you've served. Are you an indentured servant, working off the final years of debt to an unkind master? Do you serve your master's family, just as your ancestors served them before you? Do you hope to rise in your position of service in the household over a number of years, or is this only temporary work for you?


- **Skill Proficiencies**: Choose two from [[Athletics]], [[Insight]], and [[Perception]]
- **Tool Proficiencies**: One type of [[gaming set]]

**_Profession_**. The serving duties of most households are in a hierarchy based on merit and years served.

**_Feature: Position of Service_**. Interacting with upper classes takes a certain amount of tact, understanding, and deft side-stepping. It also fuels a special kind of camaraderie with the serving class, no matter who they serve. If you interact with nobility, then you know how to give them shows of deference and respect that they expect from those of lower status. If you interact with the serving class, you can use your similar experience to ingratiate yourself to them and cause them to interact with you more favorably.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Life as a servant shapes you -some find a good place in their service, some are broken by it, and some chafe against it all their lives.

**_Variant Servant: Slave_**. You spent your labor working at much the same job as any other servant, but you were not paid for your labor and your very body was owned by another. Most institutions of slavery allow for other debasements to be visited upon its slaves.
If you are currently a slave, you have a master which the legal system dictates you must answer to. If you are free, you start with documents proving your freedom as your token of service. In any case, you start with only 2 gp.
