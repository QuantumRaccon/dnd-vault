**_Feature: Planar Infusion_**. Living someplace steeped in the energy of the planes, you gain the [[Scion of the Outer Planes]] feat. In addition, you know where to find free, modest lodging and food in the community you grew up in.

**_Building a Gate Warden Character_**. Those who dwell for any extended time near a permanent portal to another plane absorb the essence radiating from the realm beyond. This creates similarities in behaviors and even physical appearances that mark someone as influenced by a particular plane.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. The influence of an Outer Plane shapes your perspective. The Gate Warden Personality Traits table suggests various traits you might adopt for your character.

|d6|Personality Trait|
|---|-------------|
|1|Strange events and otherworldly creatures don't phase me.|
|2|I think in terms of exchange; something for something, nothing for nothing.|
|3|I speak with an unusual cadence.|
|4|I pepper my speech with borrowed words or curses from planar languages.|
|5|I've seen enough to know that you can't take anyone at face value, so I scrutinize everyone I deal with.|
|6|I have a superstitious habit I picked up, such as touching iron when I'm nervous or arranging objects in a specific order.|



**_Gate Warden Trinkets_**. When you make your character, you can roll once on the Gate Warden Trinkets table, instead of on the Trinkets table in the Player's Handbook, for your starting trinket.
