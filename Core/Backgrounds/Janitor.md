You've cleaned for a large portion of your life, since you were born or since you reached adulthood. Perhaps it was a habit which you grew into, rather than something that ill-circumstances forced you into. You may have tended to a structure or building in several ways: cleaning, repairs, occasionally guarding, and so forth. Maybe you were employed by evildoers to clean up their dirty work, or maybe you overheard conversations within the imperial halls where you've worked. This kind of special environment may have been a starting point for your sense of adventure; but at heart, you simply began by being the local handyman.

Types of janitor adventurers vary based on the kind of work they did and why. There are Cinderella figures, for example, who were doing chores their whole life until something prompted them to escape their life of drudgery to search for better horizons. Darker figures also exist, like the ones who run about looking for "cleaning" jobs, usually sought after by criminals to help them get rid of evidence, or even scour away their identities.

When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine the structure or building you worked at, the said structure or building's importance, what your job was like, and why you now moved to the adventuring life. 


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Persuasion]], [[Investigation]]
- **Tool Proficiencies**: Two sets of artisan's tools, or one set of artisan's tools and a gaming set
- **Languages**: One language of your choice.
- **Equipment**: A sponge, a mop, a jar of homemade cleaning fluid, a sketch of the site you worked at, two sets of artisan's tools or one set of artisan's tools and a set of [[dice set \|bone dice]] or [[playing card set \|deck of cards]], a set of [[common clothes]], and a [[pouch]] containing 10 gp.


**_Feature: Leave No Trace_**. With your experience as a janitor, you can make a messy room or area look absolutely clean, as if no one has been in that area before. You can spend an hour in a room or area cleaning blood and stains, removing bodies and other suspicious objects, closing and re-locking containers, basically doing anything to make the room look undisturbed. Your DM might rule that some things are impossible to clean or fix, or might increase the time you'll spend if the area is extremely messy.

**_Job Site_**. You worked at a structure or building before. Roll or choose from the table below to determine the type of site you worked in. Also talk with your DM about the site and why you're now adventuring. Was the site destroyed? Did something in the site force you on a quest? Were you simply fired? Or do you still work there, adventuring as a side job to earn extra coins?

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Janitors are serious and hardworking people, but they relax and enjoy themselves earnestly when the work's done. They play just as or harder than they work. But, constantly working to make things clean and organized has made some janitors compulsive and germophobic.
