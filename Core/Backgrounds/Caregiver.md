You are a guardian of your society's youngest and most vulnerable members. As a parent, teacher, chaperone, orphanage worker, or bodyguard, you've learned to handle stress, work with others, and stay ever-vigilant.

Work with your DM to determine the role children play in your life as an adventurer. What was the nature of your relationship? If your charges are still dependent on you, where are they now? If not, why? Were they privileged or poor, and did you share this lifestyle? Why do you venture into environments hostile to children?


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Insight]], [[Perception]]
- **Tool Proficiencies**: One gaming set or musical instrument
- **Languages**: One of your choice
- **Equipment**: A set of fine or common clothes, any one gaming set or musical instrument you are proficient with, a handmade gift from a child you raised, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.


**_Feature: Suffer the Children_**. Your ability to patiently handle minors sets you apart from most adventurers, and is disarming to strangers. You can easily extract child-related information from parents and teachers. Those that witness you interacting with children will be more willing to offer aid or ask for your help, especially if they care for children themselves.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. For better or worse, the lives of child caretakers are defined by their relationships with their charges.
