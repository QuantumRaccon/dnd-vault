Governments, rebel groups, and merchant empires - all need maps to exert control and influence. You bring order to uncharted lands by transcribing their details with quill and parchment, thus offering creating a measure of power where there once was none. Perhaps you are drawn by the unfound, or you simply seek to bring order from chaos. Whatever your aims, a cartographer is an agent of discovery and control.
