You were once a being of greater power, and possessed magic beyond what mortals imagine. You were prayed to for guidance and miracles, or had worshippers among many peoples. Then you fell - you angered a powerful deity, touched a corrupted artifact, or underestimated a group of mortals. You are now reduced to a mere mortal, vulnerable and stripped of your once mighty powers to live alongside the creatures you love or despise.


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Religion]], one of your choice
- **Tool Proficiencies**: One of your choice
- **Languages**: One of your choice
- **Equipment**: A holy symbol (related to yourself), a set of common or traveler's clothes, robes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp.


**_Divine Domain_**. When you were powerful, you held superior power over a domain of action and thought. Consider what your powers entailed, and how that shaped you to be the mortal you are today. Choose your domain of power, or choose from the table below.
|d8|Domain|
|---|-------------|
|1|Reroll|
|2|Knowledge|
|3|Life|
|4|Light|
|5|Nature|
|6|Tempest|
|7|Trickery|
|8|War|


**_Feature: Protection of the Faithful_**. You have little problem convincing those that worshipped you that you are the deity they serve. You can achieve this by showing extensive and personal knowledge of the stories, artifacts, and symbols associated with yourself. You also know the names of your clerics, and a brief summary of their lives before you anointed them.
After convincing someone of your true identity, you gain their protection from hostile members of other faiths that seek to harm you, as long as you are within the city or town where the place of worship is located. They will resort to violence as a means of protecting you. If you ask them to, they will cover your tracks or delay your pursuers. They will not attack powerful foes or otherwise get into a situation more than they feel they can handle.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. The fallen once possessed great power, but it was extinguished from them. This sudden turn leave a significant mark on how they view themselves, deities, mortals, and the multiverse.

**_Variant Fallen: Forgotten_**. You are an ancient, lost to history. Fewer and fewer came to be faithful to you, and others gained dominance. You have become forgotten, both in memory and power. You now live your life as a mortal.
If your predicament is caused by a lack or absence or worshippers, choose the Old Ruins feature instead of the Protection of the Faithful feature.
> [!INFO] Variant Feature: Old Ruins
>If your character has a fallen background, you may select this background feature instead of Protection of the Faithful.
>You know the locations of abandoned places of worship dedicated to you. Aside from being completely abandoned, there is no food to be found, and there's very few or no objects aside from furniture. Although these places are in varying stages of decay, they remain intact enough to be used as shelter.
