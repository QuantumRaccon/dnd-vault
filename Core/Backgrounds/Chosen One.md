You are destined for something greaterâ€”at least, that is what everyone says. You were raised under the assumption that you were fated to fulfill some ancient prophecy. The pressure to meet the impossible expectations set upon you is immense.


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[History]], [[Religion]]
- **Languages**: Two exotic languages of your choice
- **Equipment**: A set of common clothes, a copy of the prophecy you are named to fulfil, a talisman from the god or other being that chose you, a journal, and a pouch containing 15 gp


**_Predestiny_**. It has been determined that you are the fulfillment of a prophecy. Discuss the contents of the prophecy with your DM, how it might play into your campaign, if it's true, and what your character thinks of their mission, or roll on the table below.
|d6|I will...|
|---|-------------|
|1|Save the world from a dark, evil force|
|2|End a major war or other ongoing conflict|
|3|Free an oppressed people and raise them to glory|
|4|Bring spiritual salvation|
|5|Cause the end of the world|
|6|The prophecy doesn't mention what I'll do|

|d6|Using...|
|---|-------------|
|1|My cunning, skill, and determination.|
|2|The power of some abstract virtue (i.e. love, honor, trust).|
|3|An ultimate power I'm only beginning to understand.|
|4|An unstoppable weapon only I can wield.|
|5|My own death.|
|6|The prophecy doesn't mention how I'll do it.|


**_Feature: Mark of the Chosen_**. You have an unusual physical feature that marks you as the chosen one, such as a strange birthmark, odd scar, or unnatural hair or eye color. It is in a visible place, noticeable by most people unless you cover it.
People familiar with the prophecy recognize you immediately. If they believe in and support your quest, they will be more willing to help you, as long as it doesn't put them in danger. They also might ask you to help them with their own problems using your supposed power. If they are against your quest, they will treat you with hostility and may even attack you outright.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. The chosen reach adulthood with the weight of the world on their shoulders. Believing that they are destined for great things could bolster their confidence or plague them with doubts.
