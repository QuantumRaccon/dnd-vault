You are an agent of control, creating devices in an attempt to bring time to bear. Be it by sundial, hourglass, or mechanical contrivance, time cannot be stopped, but can be held to measure and consideration. The making of timepieces requires manual adroitness and extreme attention to detail.

Most clockmakers never take up the mantle of adventurer, preferring to create and mend devices in the safety of their workshops. Did you seek to impose order on more than the gadgets in your workshop? Or was your ordered world suddenly upturned, and you seek to learn more of chaos?


- **Skill Proficiencies**: Choose two from [[History]], [[Investigation]], [[Perception]] and [[Sleight of Hand]]
- **Tool Proficiencies**: [[Tinker's Tools]]
- **Languages**: One of your choice
- **Equipment**:  Clockmaker's tools, a pocket watch or other timepiece of exacting design, traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 15 gp


**_Feature: Internal Clock_**. Your intimacy with timepieces has given you an innate understanding of time. You can immediately determine if a timepiece is slow or fast, and how to fix a problem should it exist. In addition, you do not need a timepiece to tell time, and you can determine with perfect accuracy the interval between two events.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Clockmakers are wrought by their fascination with regularity and mechanical substance.
