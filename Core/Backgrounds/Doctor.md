You are a well-trained and studied healer, sworn to cure the ailing and mend the wounded. Your talents may bring you fame and renown, or you might be regarded with suspicion by common people.

When you choose this background, work with your DM to determine the role and prominence of doctors in the world. Is medical knowledge of your kind rare? Are there institutions that teach such healing, and if so where? Were you self-taught, apprenticed to a village healer, or educated in a medical academy?

**_Feature: House Calls_**. Your talents make you highly sought after, particularly in regions or communities with little access to medicine. Those who recognize you as a doctor may request your services, and may offer you a reward in return should you choose to provide them. You might be able to receive free or discounted food and lodging, or gain access to normally off-limits locations by leveraging your position as a doctor if your services are needed.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Doctors are defined by their ability to give succor to the pained and strength to the wounded. All doctors are united by their desire to cure the ailing, although some view this ability as a means to an end instead of a gift in and of itself.
