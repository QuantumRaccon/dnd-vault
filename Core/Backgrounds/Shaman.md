You live your life as a mediator, diviner, storyteller, healer, and psychopomp. Among your people you serve as a carrier of traditions and conduit of archaic wisdom. A shaman performs spiritual services for their community, paying obeisance to those spirits that will provide boons, and doing combat with spirits that would cause harm.

**_Feature: Parley with Spirits_**. Your knowledge of a variety of spirits increases your ability to interact with them. If confronted by any intelligent spirit (as listed above), you can invoke the ancient ways of communion between your kind and theirs. You make a great display of respect and tradition, and the entity is inclined to be more favorable to you and your party. Communing gives an opening: an intelligent spirit may give a chance to talk, a friendly spirit may be more helpful, and a hostile spirit may rethink a violent act.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Shamanistic practices are employed to preserve social order and benefit individuals in your society.
