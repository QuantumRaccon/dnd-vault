Nomads are people which have no single place to call home. Many travel with an entire community and carry with them rich cultures, but some travel in much smaller groups or alone. Nomads are seldom fully welcomed by larger, more static societies, which view them as outsiders and fear their otherness. But tinkers, itinerant healers, and theatre troupes are seldom turned away.

**_Nomadic Type_**. Unconnected as you are to any greater society, you survive by alternative means.

_* An expert craftsman chooses one type of artisan's tools. You gain proficiency with those tools and your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check that uses those tools._

**_Feature: Worldly_**. Your unceasing travel of the world has allowed you to glean insights and connections into settlements you travel to. Work with your DM to determine where you have travelled in your past, if only generally. When you visit a settlement you have visited before, you know one local who can point you toward a good place to stay a night.
When you visit a settlement you have not visited before, you may spend 10 minutes observing the new location. If you do, the DM provides you with one significant observation about the location's culture. You may glean one new piece of information each day.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Nomads are continually at the outside of larger society, which separates them from many conventional social norms and customs.
