Brave deeds and danger are nothing new to you. Due to the circumstances of how you were raised, you have been involved with wandering heroes for most of your life. Maybe you were part of an adventuring band previously, but split with them after a disagreement or tragedy. Or, perhaps you worked around heroes in a lesser role for most of your young life, and you are now ready to graduate to the front lines.


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Athletics]], [[Survival]]
- **Tool Proficiencies**: Choose one from [[herbalism kit]], [[navigator's tools]] or [[thieves' tools]]
- **Languages**: One of your choice
- **Equipment**: 50 feet of rope, a small knife, a common monster part (such as an orc tusk or kobold claw) engraved with the name of a fellow adventurer, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 10 gp


**_Feature: Guild Membership_**. You are an established and respected member of an explorer's, bodyguard's, archeologist's, or other guild that employs adventurous types, allowing you to rely on certain benefits that membership provides. If you are in a town with a headquarters for your adventurer's guild and you are in good standing with the guild, you will be allowed to look at the j ob postings and find adventuring work to earn money.
Guilds often wield tremendous political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections might require the donation of money or magic items to the guild's coffers.
You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up back dues to remain in the guild's good graces.

**_Variant: Community Support_**. Some adventurers don't have the benefit of a larger organization to back their actions, but do have the support of their people or communities. If this is the case, you can choose the Local Hero feature (see sidebar) instead of the Guild Membership feature.
> [!INFO] Variant Feature: Local Hero
>Thanks to actions of you or your former adventuring party in the past, you are considered a local hero in a certain town, city, or region. While in this settlement, the locals will be willing to support you and your friends at a modest lifestyle, unless you have shown yourself to be a danger to them. They will help you in reasonable ways, but will not risk their lives for you.


**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Adventurers are well adjusted to life on the road. They are often comfortable doing dangerous things, such as dungeoneering and fighting. They can stay level-headed in the face of danger, but may not be well adjusted to other parts of life.
