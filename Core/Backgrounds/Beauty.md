You have the kind of face that can launch a thousand ships. Everywhere you go you turn heads, whether you want to or not, and it has always been easy for you to scrape by on your appearance alone. Perhaps you worked a job where looking nice was the highest requirement, like selling clothing or attracting customers to a business; or perhaps you didn't work a profession at all, and were chosen to be a courtier, paramour, or trophy spouse of someone significant. And, perhaps you became an adventurer to get away from all that.


- **Skill Proficiencies**: [[Persuasion]], [[Performance]]
- **Languages**: Two of your choice
- **Equipment**: A set of fine clothes, a hand mirror, a token of affection from an admirer, a makeup palette or shaving kit, and a purse containing 15 gp


**_Uncommonly Stunning_**. While some are naturally beautiful, others gain their beauty from another source. Work with your DM to determine the nature of your beauty, or roll on the table below.

|1|I was given a divine blessing as a reward or tool to help me complete a quest.|

**_Feature: Enchanting Appearance_**. Your appearance causes people who aren't already aggressive or hostile towards you to treat you differently. They will be more willing to interact with you or give you special treatment, especially if they are inclined to be attracted to your gender.
However, your interactions are more likely to be misinterpreted as flirtatious. Those who are helping you may attempt romantic overtures, and will be upset if you reject them. Those who see your beauty as a threat may treat you with hostility.

**_Suggested Characteristics_**. Whether your revel in your own beauty or you are annoyed at the way others treat you, your appearance shapes the way you think and behave.
