Starting at 2nd Level, you can push yourself beyond your normal limits for a moment. On Your Turn, you can take one additional Action on top of your regular Action and a possible bonus Action.

Once you use this feature, you must finish a short or Long Rest before you can use it again. Starting at 17th level, you can use it twice before a rest, but only once on the same turn.
