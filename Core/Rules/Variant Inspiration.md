Inspiration can be used in the following ways

- **Gain Advantage:** A player can use inspiration whenever he or she makes an attack roll, an ability check, or a saving throw to make that check at advantage.
- **Gain a Reroll:** On a failed roll, you may use inspiration to re-roll.
- **Healing Surge:** As a bonus action, you may use inspiration to roll a number of your Hit Dice (maximum equal to your Proficiency bonus), and add your Constitution bonus to each die result. You recover that many hit points.
- **Inspire a Character**: You can give inspiration to another player or character as a free action. Also if you have inspiration and gain inspiration, you can give to another character. 
- **Overcome a Chase Complication**: In a chase scene a participant who rolled the die or the participant affected by the complication can spend inspiration to negate the complication.
