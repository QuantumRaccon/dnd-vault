### Short Rest

-   **Tending Wounds:** There are two ways to end wounds by characters during a short rest.
    -   _Healer's Kit:_ You may use one use of a healer's kit to allow you to spend as many of your Hit Dice as you like to recover hit points. You may use this on yourself or on someone else. This constitutes both of your actions during the short rest.
    -   _Medicine Check:_ Alternately, another character may make a Wisdom (Medicine) check while working on you during the short rest. This is a DC 12 check, and constitutes both of your actions during the short rest. You may make a check for yourself, but this check is made at disadvantage.

### Long Rest

- **Recuperating Strength:** During a long rest, characters recover up to half of their Hit Dice.
- **Healing Rest:** During a long rest, you may spend as many Hit Dice as you like in order to recover hit points. This comes about as a natural part of the long rest.
