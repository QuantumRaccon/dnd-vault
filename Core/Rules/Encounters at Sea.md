The open seas provide endless opportunities for adventure. This section supplies you with a variety of random tables, perfect for detailing the challenges awaiting your characters on and beneath the waves.


**_Random Encounters_**. For each day of a voyage, in addition to checking for hazards, roll a **d20**. On a 19 or 20, the ship has a random encounter. If you roll both a hazard and a random encounter, the ship experiences both. They might occur simultaneously or in an order of your choice.
The levels given on the following tables allow you to sculpt what dangers the characters face. The low-level table is useful for when a ship travels in safe waters, while the higher-level ones are suited for primeval waters, far from well-trafficked sea lanes. The tables also allow for encounters with other ships and the discovery of mysterious, uncharted islands. Additional tables for further detailing such encounters are included later in this appendix.
