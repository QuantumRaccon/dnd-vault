Any spellcaster that can cast the [[find familiar]] spell (such as an apprentice, warlock, or wizard) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the _Player's Handbook_) or some other Tiny monster, such as a [[cranium rat]], a [[crawling claw]], a [[gazer]], an [[imp]], a [[pseudodragon]], or a [[quasit]].
