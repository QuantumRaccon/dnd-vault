# Active and Passive Checks
---
There are two types of checks: **active** and **passive**. As standard, both must be greater than or equal to a defined DC for success. 

**Active Checks**. Are involved with rolling a **d20** + modifiers and proficiencies if applicable. They are inherently random and could be used in tense or critical situations. They give spice to scenarios and leave a broader set of possibilities for the outcome. Also, they can lead to extreme results. 

**Passive Checks**. Set by a fixed number: **10** + modifiers and proficiencies if applicable. They could also be interpreted as repeating the same task over and over. They are stable and predictable and prevent ludicrous or extreme results. But predictability can make the game boring, and clever players might always match the character with the highest ability score against any given check. Inherently, this removes the risk in the game.

Advantage (Disadvantage) on active checks means rolling **2d20** and considering only the highest (lowest) number. Advantage (Disadvantage) on passive checks means adding +5 (-5) to the fixed number. 

# Partial and Ultimate Success 
---
Sometimes the randomness of a **d20** roll leads to ludicrous results. Let's say a door requires a DC 15 Strength check to batter down. A fighter with Strength 20 might helplessly flail against the door due to bad die rolls. Meanwhile, the rogue with a 10 Strength rolls a natural 20 on her first check and knocks the door from its hinges. 

If such results bother you, one might consider a mix to give more flavor by allowing a character to **ultimately succeed** or **partially succeed**. The first one represents the standard success, and the latter could represent a middle ground success with possible drawbacks or complications that would make sense in a given context. Or equivalently, it could represent a middle ground failure with possible benefits or advantages. 

# The Scenario Scheme
---
Given a scenario or situation that requires an ability, skill, or save check with a certain DC one can, optionally, classify the situation in one of the three following cases:

- **Trivial Scenario**. Requires only a passive success for ultimate success. They are generally very common for a given character. Perhaps most already tried this once or multiple times in their lives and found they either failed or succeeded. They do not usually represent a challenge for the character, and you could set them so most of the time it is a success. Examples include walking, opening a door, writing a letter, understanding that fire hurts, dealing with a common illness or flu, setting jumping distance, holding your breath underwater, finding food in a familiar place, lifting a weight, etc. Generally, this situations might allow repetition. 
- **Tense Scenario**. Requires only an active success for ultimate success. They can happen in risky situations where players are in a stressed-induced situation. Players might only have a window for success. They also allow ludicrous results as adrenaline rushes into the players, where some of them fail in trivial tasks for them and others succeed in otherwise impossible tasks for them. 
- **Mixed Scenario**. Requires both passive and active success for ultimate success. It might also lead to partial success if only one check meets success. It's up to you to decide what scenarios can be mixed. They leave possibilities to be more diverse and/or have interesting outcomes. Try to strive for memorable or unique moments.  

There is no rule set in stone for choosing one of these scenarios. There is a stiff door that the players can't open. The barbarian of the party closes by and starts to ramble about their strength and power to open the door. Such rambling might cause you to transform a trivial task for her into a mixed one, as you decide. She succeeds on the passive DC, but might fail in the active check DC. Such a failure could lead to different set of scenarios that could depend on the degree of active failure. For example, if she rolled a natural one, she might have opened the door. But because of her arrogance, she might have unmeasured her strength and passed right through it, landing prone and making a lot of noise, possibly alerting nearby enemies. 

On the contrary, a wizard with strength 8 might need to jump a cliff with DC 16. We say that he passively fails the jump. He rolled a dice and succeeds the DC. We then say that he actively succeeds. If the scenario were to be tense, he would ultimately succeed in landing on the other side with no problems. Should you choose the scenario to be mixed, he would only partially succeed. One possible complication is that the wizard barely makes it to the other side and is left hanging off the cliff requiring the other players to help him. A fighter that passively succeeds in the jump but actively fails might end up in the same situation.  

Some scenarios might only need one partial success for ultimate success. This might lower the overall difficulty of some tasks by allowing the characters with a high passive check to trivially pass without letting them roll. As well as to give the possibility for players with a low passive score to succeed by making an active roll. Equivalently in this case, for a high passive score, the task could be trivial and for a low passive score, the task could be tense. 

A trivial situation can also be transformed into a tense one. For example, a rogue proficient with lockpicking, such that is used to a specific type of lock, might find it trivial to open a similar lock. However, he might find it tense to open that same lock if a red dragon is chasing him in their lair. On the contrary. A scared and greedy character who does not know how to open the lock, in a stroke of luck, remembers how a familiar thought them a long time ago how to rake a lock and manages to open it. 

Mixed scenarios give cushion for ultimate failure to some players and can give complications to others. 

# Repeated Checks
---
It is common for a DM to make a character roll an active check in a repeatable scenario. A character might always succeed when there is no apparent time limit or consequence of their degrees of failure. If this is not what you want, consider transforming these scenarios into passive ones after (or before) a character fails his active check. However, this might be unfair for players that actively use their time to try to succeed. Considering a mixed scenario could be a solution. Some optional guidelines could be as follows: 

- If a character passively fails on a repeatable task and fails the first time in the active check. He is allowed to reroll again in a certain amount of time you define, but with a disadvantage. If he fails again, you might rule that he's unable to succeed and that a complication might arrive. After this, he might need to find an alternative solution, ask for help, or lower the DC of the check by other means allowing him to make a new check.   

- If a character passively fails on a repeatable task but succeeds the first time in the active check, by definition has partial success. You might rule that he ultimately succeeded, or that he passed the check in such a way that complications could arrive. Optionally also, you might stipulate that by partially succeeding, he failed but learned something new. This would allow him to make a new active check with an advantage after a certain amount of time you define. If he fails again, you might rule that he's unable to succeed and that a complication might arrive. After this, he might need to find an alternative solution, ask for help, or lower the DC of the check by other means allowing him to make a new check. The same applies when a character passively succeeds on a repeatable task but fails the first time. Finally, by failing on the second check, you might let him succeed, but a drawback or complication settles.

For example a group

It's really up to you what should you consider. These rules should not make the game static but rather help the flow, and allow for more memorable or interesting moments.   


# Optional: More Simple Repeated Checks
---
If these rules are complicating the game in a way you did not intend, you could instead use the following principles:

- If the outcome isn't in question, there is no roll. Tell them how long it takes and they succeed/fail automatically.
- If the outcome is in question, but there aren't any consequences for failure. There is no roll.
- If the outcome is in question and there are consequences for failure. There's a roll. If they fail they reap the consequences.

# Optional: Degrees of success or failure
---
Sometimes an ability check has different consequences depending on the degree of success or failure. A **lesser success (failure)** is when you succeed (fail) the DC by less than 5. A **great success (failure)** is when you succeed (fail) the DC by less than 10. A **critical success (failure)** is when you succeed (fail) the DC by greater than or equal to 10. 

For example, a character that greatly fails to disarm a trap might activate it. Or if he greatly succeeds to disarm it might be able to learn to construct the same trap. A critically failed Charisma (Persuasion) check to a queen might lead you to prison for your insolence or a critically succeeded check, might lead the queen to tell you more secrets or give you gold and supplies for a given journey.  

# Optional: Active Success at a Cost
---
In a **Tense Scenario**, a character might fail a roll by only a 1 or a 2, you can allow the character to partially succeed instead (or transform the situation to mixed). Leading to a possible cost of complication or drawback. Such partial success can run along any of the following lines:

- A character manages to get her sword past a orc's defenses and turn a near miss into a hit, but the orc twists its shield and disarms her. 
- A character fails to intimidate a kobold prisoner, but the kobold reveals its secrets anyway while shrieking at the top of its lungs, alerting nearby enemies. 
- A character narrowly escapes the full burnt of a fireball but ends up prone. 
- A character manages to finish an arduos climb to the top of a cliff despite slipping, only to realize that the rope on which his companions dangle below him is close to breaking. 
- A character barely jumps a cliff but manages to end up hanging. 

A player might decide to fail instead to partially succeed if she chooses to. You should give some partial information to the player about what could possibly happen if she then so chooses to take the success at a cost. You might also flip a coin to decide whether such a complication occurs or not. These rules generally only apply to characters as they are *Heroes* of the campaign. Should you consider an NPC or enemy to get partial success when failing it's up to you. 


# Drawbacks of using Mixed Checks
---
Finally, a big drawback for some DMs in this approach is tracking the passive skills of all the characters. One way to ease this process could be by asking the players the number rolled and the mod. In this way, you could determine the passive and active scores efficiently. Alternatively, in a rush, define whether a character succeeds or fails the passive check by his background or past experiences. The latter could mean that a character has learned to do something in a more consistent way. It's fair to say that a DM should strive for the passive checks of the heroes to succeed. Depending on the campaign setting this could, however, vary.
