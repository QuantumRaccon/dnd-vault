Outside of magical armor, not all armor fits every wearer. As such, it is common for denizens of the Underdark who do not have access to skilled craftsmen to wear bits and pieces of scavenged mail, cutting and binding sections together to form piecemeal armor.

-   **Piecemeal Armor:**Â Piecemeal armor provides an AC equal to one less than the best armor used in its construction.
    -   After any encounter where combat occurs, the armor requires maintenance, which can take place over a short or long rest. This requires either a leatherworker's or smith's tools, depending on the type of armor. Absent either of these types of tools, an Intelligence (DC equal to the base AC of the armor granted) check will suffice to keep it going.
    -   Taking into combat before this is done risks the armor failing during a critical point.
    -   In any combat where the wearer has not had the chance to tend to their armor, rolling a 1 on an attack roll or being hit by a critical hit causes a loss of 1d4 points of protection the armor provides. This loss is permanent; the wearer will need to scavenge new armor pieces to increase its protection again.
