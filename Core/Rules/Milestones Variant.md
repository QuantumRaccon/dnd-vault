You can also award XP when characters complete significant milestones. When preparing your adventure, designate certain events or challenges as milestones, as with the following examples:

- Accomplishing one in a series of goals necessary to complete the adventure.
- Discovering a hidden location or piece of information relevant to the adventure.
- Reaching an important destination.

When awarding XP, treat a major milestone as a hard encounter and a minor milestone as an easy encounter. If you want to reward your players for their progress through an adventure with something more than XP and treasure, give them additional small rewards at milestone points. Here are some examples:

- The adventurers gain the benefit of a short rest.
- Characters can recover a Hit Die or a low-level spell slot.
- Characters can regain the use of magic items that have had their limited uses expended.

# Milestone Rewards

- **Discoveries:** _0.5 Milestone_. Unlocking and discovering key pieces of information pertinent to the campaign can reward milestones. These pieces of information are never simple to find, and may be the result of chasing down a chain of clues or trail of other discoveries. Those who pay attention to the revelations in the game will have an easier time of accomplishing this.
- **Accomplishing Goals:** _1 to 2 Milestones_. Accomplishing specific goals rewards the heroes with milestones toward level advancement as well. Standard missions and tasks usually have one of these, and complex ones may have several.
- **Defeating Key Adversaries:** _.5 to 1 Milestones_. Defeating key adversaries results in the accrual of milestones as well. This defeat doesn't necessarily always have to be in combat; outmaneuvering them so they have no choice but to abandon plans, tricking or threatening them, and even allying with them can all result in the reward of these milestones.
