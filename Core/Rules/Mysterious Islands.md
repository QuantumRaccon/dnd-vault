Small islands dot most oceans, distant or unexplored locales that might host all manner of adventures. The following rules can be used to generate any islands the characters might encounter.


**_Island Size_**. These rules are used to generate islands with areas roughly **1d6** miles long and **1d6** miles wide. Most islands aren't perfect rectangles, and most coastlines aren't perfectly straight, so feel free to make areas of the island shorter, longer, thinner, or wider as you see fit.

**_Island Habitat_**. An island can have any habitat that seems appropriate for the clime it occupies. For example, islands of floating ice are found in arctic seas, while islands with jungle habitats are found in tropical waters. Not all islands are created by nature, though. A powerful spellcaster or divine being could conjure an island made of crystal, iron, or any material you choose.

**_Island Theme_**. Each island encountered has a theme chosen or rolled on the Island Theme table. This theme defines the island's story in one broad stroke. Once you have a theme, consult its section after the table to determine related details and story hooks.

**_Alien_**. Alien islands are inhabited by isolated creatures with ways of life beyond most beings' comprehensions. Everything about the culture of the island, from architecture to food, is unfamiliar and unsettling to outsiders. At your discretion the inhabitants of the island might speak, read, and write a language all their own.

**_Cursed_**. Cursed islands are steeped in dark magic from a ritual cast by necromancers, hag covens, evil spellcasters, foul deities, or worse. The island might still hold some hint as to why it was cursed, or all trace of those who brought down the affliction might have been scoured away.
