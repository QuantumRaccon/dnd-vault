The underwater locations in this section can be used for single-session adventures or as side treks to help you fill out the story of Saltmarsh. Each location includes a map, a description, story hooks, and encounters. You can place these locations anywhere near Saltmarsh or off distant shores of your choosing.


**_Cove Reef_**. Near the shore of a cove, a coral reef built around an alien idol teems with life. Long ago the reef was the home of merfolk enslaved by an [[aboleth]] named Ogrorlo. Lenth, a merfolk cleric of the ocean deity Eadro, killed Ogrorlo and freed the merfolk, but the influence of the aberration still lingers around the reef and in a nearby gorge that descends into darkness.

**_Cove Reef Features_**. The cove reef has the following features:
. The reef and the area around it are 50 feet below the surface of the water. The depths of the rock formations around the reef are noted on map A.5.
. Unless otherwise noted in an area's description, the cove is brightly lit by the sun during the day and dimly lit by the moon at night.

**_Cove Reef Areas_**. The following areas are keyed to map A.5.


**_C1. Blood Hawk Roost_**. Twelve [[Blood Hawk]] hunt fish in the cove and roost in six nests atop a rock formation that peeks above the surface of the water. The blood hawks attack any creature that approaches within 10 feet of the nests, fighting to the death to defend their eggs.

**_Slippery Rock_**. Algae, ocean spray, and blood hawk waste make the rock formation slippery. Moving on the rock requires a successful DC 15 Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check, and failing this check results in the creature falling into the water.


**_Treasure_**. Each nest holds **1d4-1** blood hawk eggs. Blood hawks make excellent hunting animals. Nobles are willing to pay 25 gp per intact egg.



**_C2. Crystal Cave_**. This cave has a single spherical room with a radius of 15 feet. Ogrorlo's merfolk slaves carved this cave. The aberration used the cave to meditate and rest.

**_Glowing Mosaic_**. Pink, purple, and blue crystals cover the walls in a mosaic that depicts merfolk raising their hands toward an aboleth. These crystals give off dim light that fills the cave. A [[detect magic]] spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination magic radiating from the mosaic.
A creature that takes a short or long rest in the cave receives at the end of the rest a vague vision of a danger it might face within the next 10 days. If the creature isn't an aberration, it must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw or gain a random form of short-term madness (see "" in chapter 8 of the ).
Removing a crystal from the wall causes that crystal to stop glowing and become worthless. Removing all of the crystals from the wall by hand takes 24 hours of work divided by the number of creatures performing the task (rounded down). As long as at least one crystal remains embedded in the wall, the mosaic's magic functions.



**_C3. Coral Reef_**. The reef teems with **10d10 × 10** fish of various species and **5d10** [[Crab]]. Each fish has the statistics of a [[quipper]], but it doesn't have the Blood Frenzy feature and can't make attacks.
See "Coral Reefs (GoS)" earlier in this appendix.

**_Stone Clam_**. A pedestal-like rock near the middle of the reef rises 5 feet above the coral. The rock holds an algae-covered stone statue of an enormous clam. A character who makes a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([[History]]) check knows that the clam is the symbol of the aboleth Ogrorlo.
A [[detect magic]] spell or similar effect reveals an aura of enchantment magic emanating from the statue. Every night at midnight the statue sheds bright green light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for another 20 feet for 4 hours.
A creature that touches the statue feels bolstered and happy, gaining 10 temporary hit points. This feeling also makes the creature more likely to trust others, giving it disadvantage on Wisdom ([[Insight]]) checks and saving throws against being [[charmed]] for the next 24 hours.
The statue can affect a creature only once every 24 hours. Aberrations and creatures that can't be [[charmed]] are unaffected if they touch the statue.



**_C4. Bleached Reef_**. This small reef is stark white and covered by twenty [[Crab]] crawling over it. This reef marks Ogrorlo's grave. The aboleth's loyal slaves buried the remains after Lenth killed the aberration.

**_Whispered Message_**. A creature that touches the reef hears a faint message whispered in Deep Speech: "Bend the knee, pearl. The god Ogrorlo, the shield and our protector, rests here."


**_Ogrorlo's Coffin_**. The seastone coffin of Ogrorlo, a cube 10 feet on a side, lies 12 feet beneath the floor of the reef. It is adorned with large clamshell carvings and weighs 2,000 pounds. A character who makes a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([[History]]) check knows that the clam is the symbol of the aboleth Ogrorlo.
If the coffin is opened while underwater, it releases a cloud of mucus in a 15-foot sphere that rises 10 feet toward the water's surface every round on initiative count 20. Creatures that touch the cloud must make a DC 14 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature is diseased for **1d4** hours. A creature diseased in this way can breathe only underwater. When the cloud reaches the surface, it dissipates immediately. If the coffin is opened outside the water, the mucus dissipates without effect.
The coffin holds the bones of Ogrorlo and the aboleth's treasure (see "Treasure").


**_Treasure_**. Ogrorlo's coffin holds a [[trident of fish command]] left behind as tribute by loyal merfolk slaves.



**_C5. Giant Anemone_**. This enormous orange, red, and purple anemone anchored to the side of a boulder is a trap from the time of Ogrorlo meant to guard the cove.
When a creature starts its turn within 20 feet of the anemone, it must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, the creature abandons whatever it is doing and gives in to a sudden overwhelming urge to touch the anemone, attacking creatures that get in its way. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. Aberrations, beasts, and creatures that can't be [[charmed]] are immune to this effect. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to this effect for the next 24 hours.
The anemone's tentacles deliver a poisonous sting. A creature that touches the anemone must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 11 (**2d10**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The anemone has AC 10 and 45 hit points.


**_C6. Merfolk Mass Grave_**. Fifty merfolk skeletons are buried in a mass grave 12 feet beneath the seafloor. These bones are the remains of Ogrorlo's slaves that died in the ancient battle with Lenth's forces. The top layer of skeletons peeks through the seafloor. The merfolk bones float if they are unearthed from their resting place.
A [[giant white moray eel]] hides coiled up in the bones. When the eel is hungry, it attacks any creature smaller than it.
The eel has the statistics of a [[giant constrictor snake]], with the following changes:

- The eel can breathe only underwater, its walking speed is 0 feet, and its swimming speed is 40 feet.
- It has a +4 bonus to Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks.
- It doesn't have the Constrict action option.




**_C7. Cove Gorge_**. This gorge goes down to a depth of 1,500 feet. Ogrorlo went here to be alone when it was tired of being worshiped. A [[chuul]], an ancient guardian and servant of Ogrorlo, still inhabits the bottom of the gorge. It attacks any creature that isn't an aboleth or merfolk that approaches within 60 feet of the gorge's bottom.

**_Treasure_**. The bottom of the gorge holds a stone chest carved with the image of a clam that contains a hundred tiny white pearls (10 gp each), five large pink pearls (100 gp each), and a single black pearl (500 gp).



**_Cove Reef Adventures_**. You can create your own stories for adventuring at this site or use the information in the Cove Reef Encounters table to create an adventure. You can roll randomly or choose an encounter appropriate for the average level of the characters. Each encounter is described in detail after the table.
### Cove Reef Encounters
---
|d4|Encounter|Level|
|----|-------|-------|
|1|Tentacle Trap|3rd|
|2|Worshipers of Koolooshidoop|5th|
|3|Coven of Wet Rot|7th|
|4|Elkahraal|9th|


**_Tentacle Trap_**. Two female merfolk named Talnad and Valas were kicked out of their tribe for stealing. Together with their pet [[giant octopus]] Allero, the merfolk plan to set a trap in the cove to attract adventurers and steal from them.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. To help draw the characters to the cove, Talnad and Valas unearth merfolk bones from the mass grave (area C6 (GoS)), which causes the remains to float to the surface. Fishers working in the cove find the bones and refuse to continue fishing in these waters. Eda Oweland offers the characters a special favor (see "" in chapter 7 of the ) to discover the source of the problem and end it.


**_Clever Ruse_**. Talnad and Valas stay near the top of the gorge (area C7 (GoS)), looking for creatures that have equipment they can steal. Allero, a [[giant octopus]], hides in the darkness of the gorge at a depth of 1,000 feet.
[[Merfolk Scout \|Talnad]] and [[Merfolk Scout \|Valas]] have the statistics of [[Scout]], with the following changes:

- Their alignment is chaotic evil.
- They have a walking speed of 10 feet, a swimming speed of 40 feet, and can breathe air and water.
- They don't carry longbows.


When the merfolk spy the characters, Talnad begs them for help, saying she dropped her seashell necklace in the gorge. The merfolk don't have a light source to search the bottom of the gorge and hope the characters can help. A character who makes a successful Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check contested by Talnad's Charisma ([[Deception]]) check discerns that she isn't telling the whole truth.
If the characters follow the merfolk into the gorge, Talnad and Valas lead the group to Allero and then attack. If the characters refuse to help, the merfolk whistle for Allero and attack when the octopus arrives. If this battle goes poorly for the merfolk, they dive to the bottom of the gorge toward the chuul, hoping the characters follow.
A character who captures one or both of the merfolk and makes a successful DC 12 Charisma ([[Intimidation]]) check convinces the merfolk to reveal the truth about the floating bones. Otherwise the merfolk deny knowing anything about the bones.


**_Disturbed Grave_**. If a character examines the merfolk mass grave, a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) or Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check reveals marks in the mud on the ground—some of the bones were recently dug up by webbed humanoid hands.



**_Worshipers of Koolooshidoop_**. The middle of the gorge (area C7 (GoS)) is connected to a lake in the Underdark by way of a tunnel. Fuuna, a female [[kuo-toa monitor]], and her retinue used the tunnel to reach the surface after she ordered the group to find new gods to add to their pantheon. After the kuo-toa found the stone clam in the reef (area C3 (GoS)), they named it Koolooshidoop and believed it to be a god. Before returning to the Underdark with the clam, Fuuna feels she must make a sacrifice to Koolooshidoop to avoid angering the clam.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. The crew of _Jolly Good_, a Solmor fishing boat, went for a swim in the cove, and six of the sailors never returned. Anders Solmor offers the characters 200 gp to find out what happened to the six human sailors.


**_Confronting the Kuo-toa_**. During the day, the [[kuo-toa monitor]] Fuuna, two [[Kuo-toa Whip]], and eight [[kuo-toa]] rest in the gorge at a depth of 1,000 feet. At night they form a circle around Koolooshidoop and pray. If the kuo-toa spot the characters, they attack, believing the characters to be a worthy sacrifice to their new deity. The kuo-toa aim to capture the characters and sacrifice them when the clam is glowing.


**_Corpses in the Reef_**. A character who searches the reef (area C3 (GoS)) and makes a successful DC 12 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check finds a shallow grave beneath the reef that holds the remains of six sailors from _Jolly Good_. The sailors were obviously killed by the weapons of the kuo-toa (part of the sacrifice to Koolooshidoop).



**_Coven of Wet Rot_**. The Wet Rot Coven is a group of three [[Sea Hag]] named Driftwood Moistrot, Rotten Blubbersore, and Auntie Canker. The group wants to depose Granny Nightshade (see "The Dreadwood (GoS)"). The coven used to work for Granny Nightshade and hides from her in the cove, using the magic of the crystal cave (area C2 (GoS)) to try to stay one step ahead of the night hag. The coven has no minions but is working on correcting that problem.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. The presence of the hags pollutes the water in the cove, killing the fish, which then wash up on shore. Ferrin Kastilar (see location 29 (GoS) in Saltmarsh (GoS)) offers the characters four [[potion of water breathing]] to find and end the source of this problem.



**_Help from New Friends_**. If the three [[Sea Hag]] spot the characters, they approach in the guise of three merfolk named Ranna, Caulau, and Vira, who claim that the rest of their tribe was killed by the minions of Granny Nightshade. They try to convince the characters to attack the night hag's fortress. A character who makes a successful Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check contested by the hags' Charisma ([[Deception]]) checks discerns that the "merfolk" aren't telling the truth about their tribe. If called out on their lies, the hags reveal their true nature and ask for the characters' help in overthrowing Granny Nightshade. They agree to give the characters a share of the night hag's treasure when they depose her.
If the characters attack, the hags fight back until one of them falls, and then the other two flee.


**_Dalixiateara_**. Recently the hags captured a female [[young bronze dragon]] named Dalixiateara. The dragon is chained to the side of the gorge (area C7 (GoS)) at a depth of 1,200 feet, muzzled, and [[restrained]]. The hags are trying to break the dragon's mind to force it to serve them but have had no luck so far.
The locked chains have AC 19, 50 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Auntie Canker holds the key to the chains. A character who makes a successful DC 17 Dexterity check using [[thieves' tools]] can pick the lock, freeing Dalixiateara. If freed, the dragon attacks the hags and rewards the characters who freed her with a [[cloak of the manta ray]] from her hoard.


**_Polluted Water_**. At the end of every hour spent immersed in the cove's water, a creature that isn't a hag must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. The DC for this saving throw equals 10 + the number of continuous hours spent in the cove's water. If the hags die or leave the cove, this effect ends **1d10** days later.



**_Elkahraal_**. Elkahraal is a [[marid]] in search of skilled and accomplished slaves to help him rob Favnahva, a rival genie who has a larger treasure hoard than Elkahraal does. The marid knows the history of the cove and believes that his schemes can attract adventurers to the area for him to kidnap.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. Fishers in the area report seeing tendrils made of water rise out of the sea and crash onto their boats. So far only minor damage has been caused, but rumors about these incidents have spread wildly and the local fishing crews are spooked. Keledek the Unspoken (see location 6 (GoS) in chapter 1 (GoS)) promises the characters a _cap of [[water breathing]]_ if they can discover what the shapes are and report back to him.


**_Elkahraal's Test_**. When the characters first arrive at the cove, Elkahraal, a [[marid]], casts [[invisibility]] and [[tongues]]. Elkahraal has a [[water elemental]] servant that forms the shape of an aboleth above the surface of the water, and the genie speaks to the characters as if he is the ghost of Ogrorlo, saying, "Find my remains and my pearls in one hour or I will destroy Saltmarsh!"
If the characters don't find Ogrorlo's remains (see area C4 (GoS)) and his pearls (see area C7 (GoS)), Elkahraal sends the water elemental to terrorize Saltmarsh. The elemental attacks until it is destroyed, while Elkahraal hopes to draw smarter, stronger heroes out to the cove.
If the characters find Ogrorlo's remains and the pearls, Elkahraal and his water elemental attack. His plan is to knock as many adventurers as possible [[unconscious]] and then use [[plane shift]] to bring them back to the Plane of Water. Elkahraal fights until reduced to 80 hit points and then flees, while the elemental fights until it is destroyed.



**_Wreck of the Marshal_**. The _Marshal_ was a seafaring vessel built by missionaries of St. Cuthbert. Their plan was to travel the world in the ship, bringing law, order, and the word of their god to every port. Three years ago the mission launched, but the _Marshal_ never made it to the first stop. Harpies serenaded the travelers, luring the vessel shoreward until it crashed into the rocks near Saltmarsh.

**_Wreck Features_**. The _Marshal_ has the following features:
. The outside of the _Marshal_ is covered in all manner of sharp barnacles. A creature that is pushed against the outside of the ship by magic like the [[thunderwave]] spell, or by a shove attack, or that falls [[prone]] onto a barnacle-covered surface takes 3 (**1d6**) slashing damage.
. The ceilings of the _Marshal_'s lower deck are 8 feet high, with 6-foot-high doorways connecting the chambers.
. The sea floor is 40 feet below the surface of the water. The _Marshal_'s highest point is 5 feet below the surface of the water. The depth of the rocks and various decks of the ship are noted on map A.6.
. The exposed decks of the _Marshal_ and areas outside the ship are brightly lit by the sun during the day and dimly lit by the moon at night. The interior of the ship and the sea cave are concealed in darkness.
. The wood of the _Marshal_'s hull, deck, and doors is rotting. Unless otherwise noted, a door or a 5-foot-square section of wall, ceiling, or floor of the ship has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.

**_Wreck Areas_**. The following areas are keyed to map A.6.


**_M1. Harpy Rock_**. Eight [[Harpy]] lurk in their bone-covered nests on this rock, gnawing on humanoid remains. When the harpies notice humanoids nearby, they use Luring Song to bring their prey in close before attacking. The harpies fight until four remain and then flee.

**_Treasure_**. If the characters search the harpy nests, they find a holy symbol of St. Cuthbert made with gold and sapphires (150 gp), a jasper (50 gp), a piece of obsidian (10 gp), a tiger eye (10 gp), 1,231 cp, 641 sp, 320 ep, 164 gp, and 12 pp.



**_M2. Upper Decks_**. The upper decks of the _Marshal_ have the following features:
. The upper decks are covered in barnacles (see "Wreck Features (GoS)").
. Doors leading fore and aft from the central portion of the deck give access to cabins that once were occupied by the ship's officers. These cabins (not depicted on the map) were emptied of their belongings long ago.
. The ship's iron naval ram is shaped like an enormous cudgel, the chosen weapon of St. Cuthbert.
. A 15-foot-wide, 10-foot-long pit leads 10 feet down to the cargo hold (area M3 (GoS)). It is half covered with a net overgrown with algae.
. Two trapdoors lead down to steps that end in area M3.

**_Cudgel Ram_**. A [[detect magic]] spell or similar effect reveals an aura of evocation magic around the 1,000-pound naval ram. A ship with the naval ram attached has advantage on all saving throws relating to crashing when it crashes into a creature or object. The ship and the ram suffer no damage in the crash. These benefits don't apply if another vessel crashes into the ship with the naval ram attached.



**_M3. Cargo Hold_**. The cargo hold has the following features:
. Broken crates and barrels that once held food and fresh water litter the ground.
. A 25-foot-tall marble statue of St. Cuthbert is laid horizontally and attached to the floor with rusty chains.

**_Rusty Chains_**. The chains that bind the statue of St. Cuthbert have AC 14, 18 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. The chains are rusty but solidly locked. A character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using [[thieves' tools]]. A character can break the chains with a successful DC 14 Strength check.


**_Statue of St. Cuthbert_**. The missionaries of St. Cuthbert planned to stay for months or years in most ports, so they brought along a statue of their sacred deity to display at each stop. The statue weighs 1,500 pounds.
A [[detect magic]] spell or similar effect reveals auras of enchantment and necromancy magic radiating from the statue. A creature of any nonchaotic alignment that prays to St. Cuthbert for 1 minute while within 10 feet of the statue is affected as if it just drank a [[potion of heroism]]. The statue grants this benefit to no more than one creature every 24 hours.
A creature of any chaotic alignment that prays to St. Cuthbert for 1 minute while within 10 feet of the statue must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become [[blinded]] for 1 hour.



**_M4. St. Cuthbert's Shrine_**. The missionaries fashioned this shrine so they would have a place to worship during travel. It has the following features:
. An oak altar painted with a faded image of St. Cuthbert stands at the west end of the room.
. Four rotting benches are attached to the floor.

**_Altar_**. A [[detect magic]] spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination magic radiating from the altar. A character who examines the altar and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check finds a hidden lid that allows the altar to open. The inside of the lid is mirrored. The altar's inner compartment holds a carved indentation of a holy symbol of St. Cuthbert and a coiled [[iron cobra]] that attacks any creature not wearing a symbol of St. Cuthbert.
When a creature places the _symbol of St. Cuthbert's knowledge_ (see area M8 (GoS)) in the indentation, that creature can touch the mirrored lid and cast a [[scrying]] spell (DC 17) with the altar. The altar can be used to cast this spell only once every 24 hours.



**_M5. Crew Quarters_**. The crew quarters are a mess of rotted mattresses, broken furniture, and ruined belongings.

**_Treasure_**. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check while searching the room finds a set of gilded [[navigator's tools]] (100 gp) amid a great deal of ruined paper and deteriorated clothing.



**_M6. Passenger Quarters_**. The furniture in the passenger quarters is in pieces that litter the ground.

**_Crab of Cuthbert_**. The day before the _Marshal_ sank, Clergol of the Viola, a bard and a follower of St. Cuthbert, cast the [[awaken]] spell on a crab he named Barnacle Bess. Bess has the statistics of a [[giant crab]], with the following changes:

- She is lawful neutral.
- Her Intelligence score is 10 (+0), and she can speak and understand Common.


Bess hides beneath the broken pieces of furniture. She is timid and knows very little about the ship's history, though Clergol did teach her the tenets of St. Cuthbert and how to sing a few of the god's hymns. If the characters find Bess, she tries to flee unless one of them wears a symbol of St. Cuthbert, in which case she follows that character around singing and obeys orders given to her by that character.



**_M7. Missionary Cargo_**. The door to this area is locked. A character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using [[thieves' tools]]. A character can break the door open with a successful DC 12 Strength check.
This cabin contains fifteen watertight crates of various sizes, which hold hundreds of copies of _St. Cuthbert and Common Sense_, a short book used to explain the tenets of the deity's faith to nonbelievers.


**_M8. Brig_**. The brig's door is made of rusted iron. Inside is a broken chamber pot and four skeletons wearing torn and rotted priest robes and manacles with broken, rusty chains.

**_Skeletons_**. The skeletons are the remains of the missionaries that overcame the allure of the harpies' song and tried to convince the others to put the _Marshal_ back on course. Their pleas failed, and these missionaries were imprisoned in the brig, where they ultimately drowned.


**_Symbol of St. Cuthbert's Knowledge_**. One of the skeletons is that of Uzol Telmock, a high priest of St. Cuthbert. It still carries the _symbol of St. Cuthbert's magic_ inside its robes. A [[detect magic]] spell or similar effect reveals an aura of divination magic emanating from this jade symbol of St. Cuthbert. The symbol can activate the altar in area M4.



**_M9. Cave of Lost Souls_**. This sea cave has the following features:
. The sea cave is covered in phosphorescent algae, which fills the cave with dim green light.
. The ceiling is 10 feet high.

**_Ghosts_**. Calimara and Alina are the [[Ghost]] of missionaries that died in the brig (area M8 (GoS)) along with the high priest when the ship sank. The ghosts spend most of their time in the cave. They can't stand the painful memories that come from looking at their old ship.
The ghosts are devout followers of St. Cuthbert, and they attack any creature they see committing an illegal or evil act (such as if the characters are carrying items they stole from the ship's occupants).
If the characters have committed no such acts, the ghosts ask the characters to recover their remains as well as the bones of their friends in the harpy nest (area M1 (GoS)) and the brig (area M8 (GoS)) and give them a proper burial. If the characters perform this task, the ghosts give them permission to take treasure from the _Marshal_, after which they share their knowledge of the ship's original purpose and then fade into the afterlife.



**_Wreck Adventures_**. You can create your own stories for adventuring at this site or use the information in the Marshal Wreck Encounters table to create an adventure. You can roll randomly or choose an encounter appropriate for the average level of the characters. Each encounter is described in detail after the table.
### Marshal Wreck Encounters
---
|d4|Encounter|Level|
|----|-------|-------|
|1|Vecna's Twist|5th|
|2|Merrow Mayhem|7th|
|3|Golem Diver|11th|
|4|Dragon Turtle Bandit|15th|


**_Vecna's Twist_**. The town guard of Saltmarsh recently broke up a secret cult of Vecna, an enemy of St. Cuthbert. Jander Caudron (NE male human [[cult fanatic]]) was the leader of the cult. During interrogation, Jander revealed that the cult honored Vecna by using a cursed ceremonial dagger to twist the souls of St. Cuthbert's faithful killed on the _Marshal_ into warriors of the Maimed God meant to assault Saltmarsh. The dagger is hidden somewhere in the wreck.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. Eliander Fireborn asks the characters to investigate the matter, offering 300 gp if they neutralize the threat and recover the dagger.


**_Cursed Dagger_**. The cursed dagger, decorated with the hand and eye symbol of Vecna, is hidden beneath the statue of St. Cuthbert in area M3 (GoS). A character can spot it with a successful DC 17 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check. A [[detect magic]] spell or similar effect reveals an aura of necromancy magic radiating from the dagger.
Whenever an undead creature is destroyed within 500 feet of the dagger, the creature's essence is trapped in the blade, and **1d10** days later the creature re-forms with all its hit points in a space within 10 feet of the dagger. When a creature that is not undead and does not worship Vecna touches the dagger, that creature must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[paralyzed]] for 1 hour. If the creature is still touching the dagger when the condition ends, that creature must repeat the saving throw, becoming subject to the effect again on a failure.
A character who examines the dagger and succeeds on a DC 15 Intelligence ([[Arcana]]) check discerns that casting [[dispel magic]] on the dagger or striking the dagger with a magic or adamantine weapon will cause the dagger to break. The ghosts in area M9 know how to destroy the dagger. If the dagger is destroyed, the undead it created are destroyed, and their souls return to the afterlife.


**_Vecna's Dead_**. The cultists twisted the souls of five missionaries, turning them into one [[wraith]] and four [[Specter]] that haunt the lower deck of the _Marshal_. The undead attack the characters when they come below, fighting to the death.


**_Ignoring the Threat_**. If the characters don't kill the undead and recover the dagger, the undead attack the town during the next festival thrown by Gellan Primewater.



**_Merrow Mayhem_**. Calimara Deswin (see area M9 (GoS)) was a warrior who fought the forces of Demogorgon in life. The Prince of Demons wants to keep Calimara's soul trapped in her watery grave and has sent merrow to guard the wreck.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. Gellan Primewater's smugglers bring in goods by moving through the waters near the wreck of the _Marshal_, since they know other people avoid the place for fear of the harpies. One of these boats, posing as a merchant vessel, was attacked by merrow while traveling near the wreck and barely escaped. Gellan offers the characters a letter of recommendation (see "" in chapter 7 of the ) if they can end the merrow threat.


**_Merrow_**. Relzagon is a muscular [[merrow]] (with 72 hit points), missing one eye, who spends most of her time in area M3 (GoS) with four other [[merrow]]. Another three [[merrow]] patrol the water just outside the _Marshal_. These monstrosities are on a mission from Demogorgon and fight to the death.


**_Extra Reward_**. If the characters kill the merrow and fulfill the ghost's request to lay the missionaries to rest (see "Ghosts" in area M9 (GoS)), the ghosts reward the characters with a _charm of heroism_ as they depart (see "Charms (DMG)" in chapter 7 of the ).



**_Golem Diver_**. Captain Xendros (see location 7 (GoS) in Saltmarsh (GoS)) wants the statue in the cargo hold (area M3 (GoS)) of the _Marshal_ because he knows the gift would please Iuz, an enemy of St. Cuthbert. At the same time, Arla and Vengi Carmaclo, twin mages and worshipers of St. Cuthbert, want to recover the statue for themselves.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. Captain Xendros asks the characters to recover the statue from the wreck, offering a box of [[Nolzur's marvelous pigments]] in exchange for the likeness of St. Cuthbert. Xendros warns the characters that bandits might try to recover treasure from the wreck and to be on the lookout.
If the characters recover the statue but don't give it to Xendros, he sends two [[Glabrezu]] to attack the characters while they rest.


**_Wizards_**. When the characters approach the wreck, they notice a keelboat, the _Bat Guano_, anchored in the distance. The boat belongs to the twins Arla and Vengi Carmaclo (LN human [[Mage]]), devout followers of St. Cuthbert on a mission to recover the statue, which was carved by their father, Fergos. They sent their iron golem to claim the work of art so they could avoid the harpies and are waiting for the construct to return.
If the characters are polite, the wizards happily share their mission. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Charisma ([[Deception]] or [[Persuasion]]) check convinces the mages to allow the characters to recover the statue for them. The wizards are willing to give 500 gp to the characters if they help with the recovery.
If the characters recover the statue without talking to the wizards, the mages attack the characters, demanding the statue be given to them. The mages fight until one of them falls.


**_Iron Golem_**. When the characters arrive at the wreck of the _Marshal_, Arla and Vengi's [[iron golem]] is in area M3 (GoS), breaking the chains that bind the statue before it attempts to lift it out of the ship. If the characters try to hinder the golem, it attacks, fighting until the characters retreat. The golem allows the characters to help it bring the statue back to the _Bat Guano_.



**_Dragon Turtle Bandit_**. 
Those who fish in the waters around Saltmarsh know that a [[dragon turtle]] called Xalatamos claims the wreck of the _Marshal_ as part of its domain. As long as the wreck was undisturbed, Xalatamos kept to itself—until recently, when it began threatening fishers to hand over their daily catches to pay for the theft of his treasure.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. Anders Solmor can't turn a profit with his fishing vessels if Xalatamos keeps demanding the haul. He offers the characters 1,000 gp, plus the recovery of any expenses they incur, to discover why the dragon turtle is angry and mollify it.


**_Xalatamos_**. The [[dragon turtle]] spends most of its time within 60 feet of the wreck, watching the _Marshal_. When the characters enter the area, the dragon turtle approaches, demanding to know what they are doing in its domain. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Charisma ([[Persuasion]]) check convinces Xalatamos to speak with them. Otherwise, Xalatamos demands tribute in the form of coins and gems worth no less than 500 gp before speaking further with the characters.
If the tribute is forthcoming, Xalatamos tells the characters that it kept a [[staff of power]] in the crew quarters (area M5 (GoS)), but the item went missing ten days ago. The creature is certain a thief from Saltmarsh took the staff, and it intends to make the fishers of the town pay until the item is returned. A character who succeeds on a DC 13 Charisma ([[Persuasion]]) check convinces Xalatamos to let the characters explore the wreck for clues of where the lost staff could be.
If the characters try to explore the wreck without its permission, Xalatamos attacks. It fights until reduced to 100 hit points and then flees.


**_What Really Happened_**. The culprit is none other than Keledek the Unspoken (see location 6 (GoS) in Saltmarsh (GoS)). After using research and magic to discern that an item of power was likely buried somewhere aboard the _Marshal_, he conjured a water elemental and sent it forth to uncover what it could. The elemental found the staff and, remaining undetected, escaped the ship and returned to Keledek with its prize.


**_Finding the Staff_**. If the characters search the crew quarters (area M5 (GoS)), they find an important piece of evidence among the debris: the moldy remains of what was once an ornate wooden case meant to hold a staff. Where the head of the staff would rest, the outside of the case is sculpted in the image of a beholder.
If the characters take this knowledge (or the item itself) back to Saltmarsh and ask around, someone who makes a successful DC 14 Charisma ([[Investigation]]) check finds out that Keledek has been sporting a new staff recently—and the head of the staff is a miniature sculpture of a beholder. If Keledek is confronted about the item, a successful DC 15 Charisma ([[Intimidation]] or [[Persuasion]]) check convinces Keledek to give the staff to the characters so that they can return it to its rightful owner.
If the staff is given back to Xalatamos, he stops harassing the fishers and hides the staff in a more secure location.



**_Warthalkeel Ruins_**. Centuries ago, Warthalkeel was a settlement built on a seaside cliff. Its people worshiped a kraken named Vaalastroth. The kraken would visit the town once every decade, giving orders and taking treasure as tribute from the people before descending into the deep to slumber. Malek Trandence, a priest of Procan, visited Warthalkeel and persuaded the people to worship the god of the sea. When Vaalastroth next returned, the kraken was furious at the people's betrayal. Vaalastroth broke the cliff beneath Warthalkeel, sending the town into the water. Rumors of hidden treasure and strange magic in the town's ruins sometimes attract explorers into the depths.

**_Warthalkeel Features_**. The ruins of Warthalkeel have the following features:
. The ceilings in enclosed buildings are 10 feet high, with 8-foot-high doorways between the chambers.
. The seafloor on which the ruins sit is at a depth of 100 feet. The depth of ledges below the surface of the water and the height of those above are noted on map A.7.
. Areas exposed to the outside are brightly lit by the sun during the day and dimly lit by the moon at night. Enclosed areas have no light sources.
. The ruins are made of stone. A door or a 5-foot-cubic section of wall, ceiling, or floor has AC 17, 27 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.
. The ruins are filled with seawater.

**_Warthalkeel Areas_**. The following areas are keyed to map A.7.


**_W1. Warthalkeel Cliffs_**. These cliffs once held the town of Warthalkeel. Climbing the walls of the cliffs without equipment requires a DC 15 Strength ([[Athletics]]) check.


**_W2. Vaalastroth Trench_**. The floor of the trench is at a depth of 10,000 feet. An entrance to the kraken's lair lies somewhere in the deepest part of the trench.


**_W3. Ruined Buildings_**. These buildings are so utterly demolished that it is impossible to know what purpose they served. Swarming around each ruin are **3d10** fish of various species and **2d4** [[Crab]]. Each fish has the statistics of a [[quipper]], but it doesn't have the Blood Frenzy feature and can't make attacks.
Characters who dig through the rubble of a ruined building for 10 minutes find an object on the Ruin Objects table.
### Ruin Objects
---
|d10|Object|
|----|------------|
|1|Human bones|
|2|An iron holy symbol of Procan|
|3|A tin toy kraken|
|4|A rusted blade engraved with a tentacle|
|5|The cover of a book of hymns to Procan|
|6|A rusty tool, weapon, or armor|
|7|An engraving, sculpture, or other work of art depicting a kraken|
|8|An engraving, sculpture, or other work of art depicting Procan|
|9|A broken piece of a boat|
|10|A stuffed and preserved octopus corpse|



**_W4. Windmill_**. The wood blades of the windmill are gone, and the inside of the mill is covered in rubble from the grinding wheel that broke apart when the building was submerged. Two human skeletons lie among the rubble.
Two  occupy the mill. When a creature enters the building, the undead attempt to lead the creature into Vaalastroth Trench (area W2 (GoS)), whispering promises of treasure.


**_W5. Kraken's Vault_**. The people of Warthalkeel built a vault to store the treasures earmarked for Vaalastroth.

**_W5a. Guard Post_**. Stone benches line the walls, and a stone counter stands before the vault doors. Three human skeletons in rusted chainmail lie on the floor.


**_W5b. Vault_**. The door to the vault is locked with an [[arcane lock]] spell. A character can pick the lock with a successful DC 25 Dexterity check using thieves' tool or force the door open with a successful DC 30 Strength check. Touching the door with a bone from the high priest's skeleton (in area W7d (GoS)) unlocks the door.
If a creature touches or attacks the door while it is locked, the door produces a spectral tendril that makes an attack against the creature with a +7 bonus. If the tendril hits, it deals 11 (**2d6 + 4**) psychic damage.
Most of the vault's treasures were removed from the vault when Warthalkeel's citizens converted to the worship of Procan, but a stone chest in the vault contains 1,232 gp and 213 pp.



**_W6. House of Procan_**. The house of Procan was erected to replace the Temple of Vaalastroth (area W7 (GoS)).
Malek Trandence secretly worshiped Erythnul, the god of slaughter. He knew that converting Warthalkeel to a new religion would bring down the kraken's wrath, pleasing his true god.

**_W6a. Chamber of Prayer_**. A chipped statue of Procan holding a trident in one hand and a piece of coral in the other stands on the east wall. A human skeleton lies at the feet of the statue.


**_W6b. Reflection Chamber_**. A glass fish tank overgrown with kelp stands on the east wall, and a mosaic of Procan's coral trident holy symbol is built into the ceiling. A [[giant crab]] hides in the kelp and attacks any creature that disturbs it.


**_W6c. Priest's Office_**. Broken wood furniture lies on the cracked floor. A 2-foot-diameter hole in the ceiling allows light from outside to enter and provides entry and exit to the [[swarm of quippers]] that lives here.
A character who searches through the debris on the floor finds a gold holy symbol of Procan (15 gp).


**_W6d. Priest's Room_**. Broken wood furniture and rusty mattress springs cover the floor.
A character notices the outline of a secret compartment in the wall with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check. The compartment holds an iron holy symbol of Erythnul.


**_W6e. Shrine to Erythnul_**. All doors to this area are locked. A character can pick the lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tool or force the door open with a successful DC 20 Strength check.
The skeletal remains of several beasts litter the floor, and an altar to Erythnul made of bones stands on the east wall. A magic morningstar lies on the altar. This weapon has the Curse property of a [[berserker axe]] and no other magical properties.


**_W6f. Shrine to Procan_**. Six cracked stone benches line a path leading up to a stone altar of Procan on a 2-foot-high dais at the south end of the room. Four human skeletons lie on the floor.



**_W7. Temple of Vaalastroth_**. A four-story temple honoring Vaalastroth served as Warthalkeel's house of worship and seat of government for years. After Malek Trandence converted most of the townspeople to the worship of Procan, a few priests loyal to the kraken remained in the temple, preaching Vaalastroth's word only to each other.

**_W7a. Entry Chapel_**. The chapel's floor, walls, ceiling, and columns are painted with a mosaic of a kraken reaching its tentacles up into a stormy sky. An altar shaped like a kraken's head stands in the center of the room.
Twenty [[Octopus]] swim in place around the room. They attack only to defend themselves.


**_W7b. Supply Closets_**. These supply closets held food and liturgical materials that were lost to or broken by the sea. A closet has a 25 percent chance of containing a hungry quipper and a 10 percent chance of containing an object from the 25 gp  in chapter 7 of the .


**_W7c. Meditation Chamber_**. Tattered tapestries and cold, rusty braziers decorate this chamber. [[Yalaga Maladwyn]] sits cross-legged in the center of the room. She is a drow priestess of Lolth, with the following changes:

- Yalaga is undead.
- She doesn't have the Fey Ancestry trait or the Summon Demon action option.


Yalaga was a loyal priestess of Vaalastroth until the end of her life and continues to be so in undeath. She meditates in this chamber trying to hear the voice of Vaalastroth, which has been silent for her since Warthalkeel's destruction.
If she notices the characters, Yalaga immediately begins asking why they have come to Warthalkeel. A character who succeeds on a DC 14 Charisma ([[Deception]] or [[Persuasion]]) check convinces her they mean no harm. If convinced, Yalaga shares Warthalkeel's history and allows the characters to explore the temple as long as she can escort them.
If the characters can't convince Yalaga they mean no harm, or if she catches them stealing or defacing any property in the temple, she attacks and fights to the death (though she doesn't leave the temple to follow the characters if they flee).


**_W7d. High Priest's Chambers_**. The door to these chambers is locked. A character can pick the door's lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check using thieves' tool or force the door open with a successful DC 20 Strength check.
Halkal Kyrith, the high priest of Vaalastroth, died cowering in his chambers for failing to defend the worship of the kraken. The high priest's skeleton lies in rotting robes amid debris on the floor, clutching a [[tentacle rod]].


**_W7e. Balcony_**. The balcony is 10 feet above the seafloor. The tops of the 3-foot-high parapets are carved to look like tentacles.


**_W7f. Crumbling Hall_**. A crumbling mosaic depicts a kraken devouring an entire planet on the ceiling of this chamber. A creature that touches the walls, floor, or ceiling of this chamber must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (**1d6**) damage from falling debris.


**_W7g. Grand Staircase_**. This staircase's stone railing is carved to look like a long tentacle. A [[giant octopus]] lives under the stairs and attacks only if disturbed. [[Yalaga Maladwyn]] (see area W7c (GoS) sits cross-legged in the center of the room. She is a drow priestess of Lolth, with the following changes:}) feeds this octopus and considers it a friend. A character can peacefully coax the octopus from its nest with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[Animal Handling]]) check.
A gold kraken statuette (100 gp) lies amid the waste in the octopus's nest.


**_W7h. Ballroom_**. The ballroom once hosted grand celebrations in honor of Vaalastroth. A 10-foot-diameter, 200-pound crystal chandelier shaped like a kraken (750 gp) hangs from the ceiling. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Dexterity check using [[mason's tools]] can safely remove the chandelier from the ceiling. The chandelier is fragile. If takes any damage, it becomes worthless.


**_W7i. Private Room_**. This room offered privacy to important ballroom guests. A stone table shaped like a kraken sits in one corner. A long prayer to Vaalastroth is carved into its surface.


**_W7j. Tower Roof_**. The top of this tower holds an indentation of one of Vaalastroth's tentacles, marking where the kraken touched the building to bless it. A creature that touches the indentation feels an overwhelming desire to pray to the kraken. If a creature offers a prayer to Vaalastroth, the creature must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature gains a _charm of animal conjuring_ (see "Charms (DMG)" in chapter 7 of the ), but can conjure only [[Octopus]] and [[Giant Octopus]]. On a failed save, the creature takes 16 (**3d10**) psychic damage.



**_Warthalkeel Adventures_**. You can create your own stories for adventuring at this site or use the information in the Warthalkeel Encounters table to create an adventure. You can roll randomly or choose an encounter appropriate for the average level of the characters. Each encounter is described in detail after the table.
### Warthalkeel Encounters
---
|d4|Encounter|Level|
|----|-------|-------|
|1|Mephit Mischief|1st|
|2|Lizardfolk Games|3rd|
|3|Release the Kraken|11th|
|4|Extended Life|13th|


**_Mephit Mischief_**. Gali, a curious merfolk teenager, stumbled upon a green conch shell in Warthalkeel's ruins. When she blew on the shell, a one-way portal from the Plane of Earth appeared, and out of the portal came a mud mephit. The mephit stole the shell and dropped it somewhere in the ruins before heading to the surface. As the days passed, more mephits emerged from the portal, heading to the mainland to cause mischief.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. Over several days recently, [[Mud Mephit]] have appeared in Saltmarsh to steal food, pull pranks, and annoy people. Wellgar Brinehanded (see location 26 (GoS) in Saltmarsh (GoS)) tracked the mephits back to Warthalkeel's ruins. He offers the characters 100 gp to find and close the portal that the mephits are coming through. If the characters take the job, Wellgar gives each a [[potion of water breathing]] before they go to the ruins.


**_Elemental Portal_**. The 2-foot-diameter portal is located on the sea floor just outside area W7 (GoS). Every **1d6** hours, a [[mud mephit]] emerges from the portal and swims for the surface. If the green conch shell is destroyed, the portal closes.


**_Gali_**. Gali, a [[merfolk]], searches the ruined building (area W3 (GoS)) directly east of the Temple of Vaalastroth (area W7 (GoS)). She saw the mephit that stole the conch shell swim over the temple and then over the ruined building. She didn't see where the mephit dropped the shell. If she notices the characters, she flags them down, begging for help and sharing her story.


**_Green Conch Shell_**. The green conch shell was dropped into area W7f (GoS) of the Temple of Vaalastroth. A [[detect magic]] spell or similar effect reveals an aura of conjuration magic around the shell. If the shell is destroyed, the portal closes.


**_Treasure_**. If the characters close the portal, in gratitude Gali gives them a [[potion of climbing]] she found in an old shipwreck.




**_Lizardfolk Games_**. Wynce, queen of the Black Claw lizardfolk tribe, holds a series of athletic games every year to challenge her best warriors. These games are legendary among the Black Claw, for the grand prize is always an item of great power. This year the games take place in the water over the ruins of Warthalkeel.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. Eliander Fireborn tells the characters that a group of lizardfolk has gathered in the water above the ruins of Warthalkeel. He asks the characters to greet the lizardfolk on behalf of the town and find out why they're close to the town. Eliander offers the characters 250 gp to talk to the lizardfolk and gives each character a [[potion of water breathing]] before they set out. He expects the potions back if the characters don't use them.


**_Let the Games Begin_**. Wynce, a [[lizardfolk shaman]], six of her finest [[lizardfolk]] warriors, and thirty [[Lizardfolk Commoner \|lizardfolk commoners]] (see appendix C (GoS)) are gathered in twelve canoes on the surface of the water when the characters arrive. Wynce welcomes the characters and explains why the Black Claw tribe is congregating. Not one to let a chance for a challenge go by, Wynce invites the characters to participate in the games.
Wynce oversees the games. She is a fair judge and allows the use of magic in the following contests:
. The participants in this game hurl a sea turtle shell across the water. All those participating make Strength ([[Athletics]]) checks. The participant with the highest check total makes the farthest toss and wins. The winner keeps the impressive shell as a trophy.
. The players of this game stand on a large piece of driftwood, keeping their balance on the shifting waters. All those participating make Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) checks. The highest check total wins. The winner keeps the driftwood as a trophy.
. Wynce casts [spell] to conjure eight [[Quipper]]. The winner of the game is the one who grapples and holds onto a quipper longer than any of the other players and is rewarded with a crown made of quipper bones.
. Each competing character battles a lizardfolk in the water. The battle continues until a creature submits or is defeated. The lizardfolk submit when reduced to 5 hit points, and if they reduce a character to 0 hit points with a weapon attack, the character is automatically stabilized. The winner of each match gets a pearl worth 10 gp as a prize.


**_Main Event_**. After the initial games, Wynce announces the main event. She has given a [[ring of swimming]] to a "stone-faced guardian" in the ruins of Warthalkeel. Normally she would divide her warriors into teams, but if the characters compete, she pits her warriors against them. The team that brings the ring to the surface wins and gets to keep the ring.
The [[ring of swimming]] is around one of fingers of the statue of Procan in area W6a (GoS). It takes the lizardfolk 1 hour to find the ring. If the characters find the ring in less time that, they win.



**_Release the Kraken_**. The Society of Tentacles is a group of cultists that worship krakens. Elagoth Rinecot, the cult's leader and a descendant of the people of Warthalkeel, wants to call forth Vaalastroth and apologize for her ancestors' betrayal. The priest also plans to offer the characters to the kraken as tribute.


**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. Calduran Bravewater, a [[deep scion]] (see appendix C (GoS)), approaches the characters posing as a rich noble and asks for their help in diving into the ruins of Warthalkeel to find lost treasure. He offers to give the characters whatever it takes to persuade them to go to the ruins (since he has no intention of paying).


**_Society of Tentacles_**. Two [[Kraken Priest \|kraken priests]] (see appendix C (GoS)) and a [[deep scion]] (see appendix C (GoS)) desecrate area W6f (GoS) of the House of Procan while another four [[Kraken Priest \|kraken priests]], including Elagoth Rinecot, hold hands in a circle and chant to perform the ritual in area W7h (GoS) of the Temple of Vaalastroth. The cultists attack the characters with the intention of subduing them.
[[Yalaga Maladwyn]] (in area W7c (GoS)) knows of the cultists and allows them to perform the ritual, though she suspects that waking the kraken could anger it, so she avoids participating.
Calduran tries to steer the characters toward area W6f (GoS) but turns on the characters when they find either group of cultists.


**_The Kraken Cometh_**. If the cultists defeat the characters, the kraken priests use their [[water breathing]] spells to keep the characters alive and then bind them with [[manacles]] (see chapter 5 in the ) near Vaalastroth Trench (area W2 (GoS)). The cultists complete their ritual 12 hours after they capture the characters. A loud hum rings through the area, and then Vaalastroth the [[kraken]] rises from the trench.
Elagoth offers the characters as tribute, claiming that these powerful adventurers are the greatest threats to Vaalastroth's takeover of the settlement. Vaalastroth then attacks the cultists, calling them insolent for disturbing its slumber and offering such a paltry gift. If the characters have not escaped by the time the kraken kills the cultists, it demands all the characters' magic items in exchange for their lives. When it is satisfied, the kraken returns to its lair.



**_Extended Life_**. The ancient storm giant Brinecane Ulganoth is terrified of death. To cheat the inevitable, Brinecane drew on the magic of Warthalkeel's ruins, transforming himself into a mighty storm.

**_Saltmarsh Story Hook_**. For days, a powerful storm unlike any seen before rages over Saltmarsh. Ferrin Kastilar (see location 29 (GoS) in Saltmarsh (GoS)) tells the characters that he believes the cause of the storm is unnatural, since its borders never move and the ruins of Warthalkeel are at its center. The storm threatens everyone in Saltmarsh, so Ferrin has convinced the nobles to pledge 3,000 gp to the characters if they can find and stop the cause of the danger.


**_Calming a Storm_**. Brinecane Ulganoth has transformed himself into a [[storm giant quintessent]] (see appendix C (GoS)), and the ruins of Warthalkeel are his lair. The giant spends his days in area W7h (GoS) making music with his harp—the calm in the eye of the storm.
[[Yalaga Maladwyn]] (in area W7c (GoS)) knows she can't kill the giant, so she allows him to do whatever he wants. She would agree to ally with the characters in a plan to evict Brinecane.
When the characters find Brinecane, the giant tells them of his plight. He is scared to die, but he knows that without the magic of Warthalkeel he would succumb to old age.
If the characters offer to help Brinecane, he tells them he would agree to move to a new location touched with magic that would allow him to continue to extend his life. One such location that would put the storm far from Saltmarsh is Granny Nightshade's fortress, Castle Spiral, in the Dreadwood. Of course, Brinecane requires that Granny Nightshade and her minions be removed before he takes possession of the castle.
A character can comfort Brinecane and convince the storm giant to accept the inevitable, end the storm, and move out of the area with a successful DC 22 Charisma ([[Persuasion]]) check. If this check fails, Brinecane is insulted and attacks the characters.
If combat breaks out, the giant fights until reduced to 30 hit points and then flees.
