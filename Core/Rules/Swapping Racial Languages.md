This optional rule allows you to exchange a language granted by your race for a different standard language. Your DM must approve the language you select. This is a way to reflect a character with no ties to the culture of their race. Halfling is the language of the Talenta Plains; if a halfling was raised in the Mror Holds, they might replace Halfling with Dwarvish to reflect this.
