The game statistics of a player character transformed into a [[vampire spawn]] and then a [[vampire]] don't change, except that the character's Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution scores become 18 if they aren't higher. In addition, the character gains the vampire's damage resistances, [[darkvision]], traits, and actions. Attack and damage rolls for the vampire's attacks are based on Strength. The save DC for Charm is 8 + the vampire's proficiency bonus + the vampire's Charisma modifier. The character's alignment becomes lawful evil, and the DM might take control of the character until the vampirism is reversed with a [[wish]] spell or the character is killed and brought back to life.


**_Jiangshi_**. Humanoids killed by a [[jiangshi]] rise as life-hungry corpses and might turn into jiangshi themselves if they feed upon the living.
