_1st-level wild magic feature_

Your spellcasting can unleash surges of untamed magic. Once per turn when you cast a 1st level spell or higher roll an additional d20, if you roll lower than or equal to you chaotic charge, roll on the Wild Magic Surge table. Additionally, your DM may determine that an area is overflowing with magical energies, your emotional state has compromised your self-control, or any other number of factors are impacting your ability to cast magic while containing your powers, and make you roll a d20 contested with your accumulated chaotic charge.
