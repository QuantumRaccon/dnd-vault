_1st-level wild magic feature_ 

Your body becomes a vessel for wild magic to coalesce. Every time you cast a 1st level spell or higher, you accumulate a number of chaotic charges equal to the spell level that was casted. The maximum accumulated charge is 20. When you roll on the Wild Magic Surge table the charge resets to 0.
