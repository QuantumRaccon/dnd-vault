# Wild Magic Variant
---

Your innate magic comes from the forces of chaos that underlie the order of creation. This entropic magic draws its power from the elemental chaos and it is adverse to reality itself; raw magic in its pure form, your soul and body have been exposed in an unprecedented way. Your simplest gestures or emotional outbursts draw forth powerful enchantments and waves of destruction.
