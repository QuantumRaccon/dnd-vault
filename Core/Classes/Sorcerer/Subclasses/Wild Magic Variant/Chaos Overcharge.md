_6-level wild magic feature_

Your wild magic can disrupt the natural flow of the Weave, you can gain access to sources of raw magic. Once per long rest, when you have no spell slots left, you can use a bonus action to regain expended spell slots. The spell slots can have a combined level that is equal to or less than half your sorcerer level (rounded up), and none of the slots can be 6th level or higher. As soon as you take this bonus action you must roll on the Wild Magic Surge table. After you use this feature every spell you cast will trigger a Wild Magic Surge until you finish a long rest.
