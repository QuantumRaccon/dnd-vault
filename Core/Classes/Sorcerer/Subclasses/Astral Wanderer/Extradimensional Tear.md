_6th level Astral Wanderer feature_ 

Your weapon attacks can rip/tear/slash through reality itself, opening an unstable rift to the Astral Sea, for then to implode.

As an action, you may spend 3 sorcery points to choose one point within 60 ft of you. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A target takes 9d6 force damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.  Every creature that fails the save is pushed 5 feet into the origin of the implosion and is knocked prone.

You may use this feature once per long rest.
