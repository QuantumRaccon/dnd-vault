_1st level Astral Wanderer feature_ 

You gain the ability to fold local space at your will for a limited space and time. Effectively changing the topology of space. 

You can open two dimensional portals, whose aperture is no bigger than 10x10 ft. They are linked together such that space is connected from one to the other. Any creature or object that enters one portal exits through the other retaining its kinetic energy and orientability. If a creature looks at the aperture of the portal, it is able to see outwards through the other portal, as if looking through a window. If a creature or object can be seen from the window of vision of the portal, any ranged attack/spell/action can be taken from one side through the portal, exiting from the other. In the same logic any area of effect translates from one side through the other. An individual portal has two opposite sides, each of these connect to a specific side of the other portal. An arrow of direction can be drawn to specify which side is connected to which. 

These portals take a bonus action to create and last for a number of rounds equal to your total level. They must be created in an unoccupied space that you can see up to 120 ft, and must be within 100 ft of each other. You may only have one set of portals active at a time. You can dispel them as a bonus action. 

Should your vision be obstructed, through the wearing of eye contacts for instance, you are rendered incapable of opening rifts as it prevents you from seeing the Astral Plane. You can use this ability up to your Charisma modifier per long rest.Â 

A spell such as [[Dispel Magic]] can close the portals instantly. If the portals are closed and a creature or object is in between the aperture of the portals, it exits a random portal (1d2) and is pushed 5 ft out of the aperture before closing.
