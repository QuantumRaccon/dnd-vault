_14th level Astral Wanderer feature_ 

You learn to defensively utilize your portals. IfÂ you make a successful saving throw against an attack, or an attack roll misses you, you can choose another creature (including the attacker) you can see within 120 feet of you. The attack targets the chosen creature instead of you. If the attack forced a saving throw, the chosen creature makes its own save. If the attack was an attack roll, the attack roll is rerolled against the chosen creature. You may use this feature once per short rest. Using this feature also dispels your active Portals.
