_1st level Astral Wanderer feature_ 

You can draw on the energy of the planar multiverse to augment your a two-handed or versatile melee weapon.  

-   **Imbue Astral Energy:** As a bonus action, you can imbue astral energy into your attacks for one minute, you do extra force damage from those attacks equal to your proficiency bonus, and they are a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 on the d20. You can use this ability up to your Charisma modifier per long rest.  
-   **High Velocity Impact:** As a reaction to hitting a target with a melee weapon attack, you may choose to use your reaction to cause that creature to have vulnerability to all of that attack's damage. You can not use this feature again until you finish a long rest.
-   **Pocket Dimension:** As a bonus action, you may shunt this weapon into an extradimensional space to store it, recalling it later into your hands with a bonus action later on.
