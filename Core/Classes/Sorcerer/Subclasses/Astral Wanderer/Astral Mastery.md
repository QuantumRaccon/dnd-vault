_18th level Astral Wanderer feature_ 

You gain a relative mastery over the Astral Sea. All of your rift related abilities increase in range to 1000 feet. You also gain immunity to force damage.

You learn to manipulate the Aether around and within other creatures. As an action, you may spend 6 sorcery points and compress the Aether in a creature that is within 1000 feet of you, and they must make a Constitution saving throw. If they fail, they are reduced to 0 hit points. If they succeed, they take 10d10 force damage.
