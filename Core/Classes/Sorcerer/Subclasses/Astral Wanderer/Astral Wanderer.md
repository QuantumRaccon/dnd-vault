---

You have been altered by a powerful being of the Astral Plane. Your essence has been augmented by an ancient who travels the Aether in search of knowledge and holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born. Its motives are often inscrutable, and its knowledge so immeasurable and ancient that no mortal catalogue could compare to the vast mysteries it holds. Your change may have been purposeful by the entity, or inadvertent potentially from it being dimensionally close during your birth. You may be a random soul from the nether reborn, a servant of that entity that has been reborn in mortal form, or a new soul who was simply imbued with planar energy that allows you to experience the smallest glimmer of the Astral Sea itself and its connection to everything throughout the multiverse. This power is also seen frequently in plane touched beings like Githyanki, Tieflings, or Aasimar. You are destined to wander existence seeking new knowledge and planar locations becoming a new Astral Wanderer.  
  
The entity that was the genesis of your power could be any dedicated to exploration or knowledge of forgotten lore or other deities like The Far Wanderer, The Opener of the Ways, The Gray Voyager, The Lord of Knowledge, The Sovereign of Law and Lore, or The Gate of Souls. Being connected to such power can cause changes in your behavior and beliefs making you experience wanderlust and a desire to explore both through travel and knowledge seeking, as well as manifest physical changes as your body is suffused and permeated with planar energy giving you an ethereal presence. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Astral Manifestations table to create identifiers for your character.

| 3  | You alternate giving off a slight radiance or dark gloom in time with waxing & waning positive/negative planes.           |
| 4  | When injured, your blood seeps extremely slowly even when gravely injured & looks like mercury-like platinum astral ether. |
| 5  | Your hair grows a streak of silver that naturally braids like a mithril cord.                                              |
| 6  | Your shadow is slightly displaced from your physical being.                                                                |

All Astral Wanderers have eyes that resonate with the Astral Sea, often resulting in strange colours or patterns in the eye.

Astral Wanderers gird themselves with magical power blended with martial fighting prowess, and guard the prime material plane against threats that originate from other planes or that seek to pillage the mortal realm with alien arcana. They discover and guard portals between planar worlds or stand vigilant against threats from them, including traveling the Aether as needed to prevent harm. These Sorcerers are defenders of the remnants of the heavenly lattice and seek to preserve the order of the world above.

Astral Wanderers have a knack for spells that focus on movement and forces helping to augment their martial fighting capabilities with raw magical power slipping between spaces as is the nature of the planar travel, and often learn [[Gate]], [[Etherealness]], [[Plane Shift]], [[Arcane Gate]], or [[Teleport]] as their higher level spells.
