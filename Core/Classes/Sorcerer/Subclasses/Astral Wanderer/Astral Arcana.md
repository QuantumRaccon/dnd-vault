_1st level Astral Wanderer feature_ 

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown on the Astral Arcana table. Each spell counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know. These spells can't be replaced when you gain a level in this class:

| Spell Level | Spells                               |
|-------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1st         | [[Gift of Alacrity]], [[Longstrider]]        |
| 2nd         | [[Immovable Object]], [[Pass without Trace]] |
| 3rd         | [[Blink]], [[Pulse Wave]]                    |
| 4th         | [[Dimension Door]], [[Freedom of Movement]]  |
| 5th         | [[Steel Wind Strike]], [[Wall of Force]]     |
