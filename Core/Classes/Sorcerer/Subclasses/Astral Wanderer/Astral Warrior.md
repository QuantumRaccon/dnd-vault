_1st level Astral Wanderer feature_ 

You acquire the training necessary to effectively arm yourself for battle. You gain proficiency with light, medium armor, and two handed or versatile martial weapons. You may adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can't take the same Fighting Style option more than once, even if you get to choose again.  

-   **Defense:** While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC.
-   **Great Weapon Fighting:** When you roll a 1 or 2 on a damage die for an attack you make with a melee weapon that you are wielding with two hands, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll, even if the new roll is a 1 or a 2. The weapon must have the two-handed or versatile property for you to gain this benefit.
