# Actions
---

|Cannon|Activation|
|---|---|
|Flamethrower|The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate. Each creature in that area must make a Dexterity saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 2d8 fire damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.|
|Force Ballista|Make a ranged spell attack, originating from the cannon, at one creature or object within 120 feet of it. On a hit, the target takes 2d8 force damage, and if the target is a creature, it is pushed up to 5 feet away from the cannon.|
|Protector|The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of your choice within 10 feet of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).|


# Features
---
- Damage Immunities: poison, psychic.
- Condition Immunities: all conditions.
- Healing: The cannon regains 2d6 HP whenever Mending is cast on it.
- Cannon Type: Upon creation, the creator decides what type of cannon it is: Flamethrower, Force Ballista, or Protector. What feature/attack it can use depends on its type.
- Protector: The cannon emits a burst of positive energy that grants itself and each creature of its creator's choice within 10 ft of it a number of temporary hit points equal to 1d8 + its creator's Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).


# Traits
---

- Creator: The cannon doesn't act unless activated by its creator. It uses its creator's artificer spell attack, spell save DC, and has five times the artificer level in HP. It disappears after 1 hour, when reduced to 0 HP, or when its creator dismisses it as an action.
- Activation: The creator of the cannon can activate it as a bonus action while within 60 ft of it. Once activated, the cannon does as instructed, moves and uses the action associated with its type: flamethrower attack, force ballista attack, or protector feature.
- Detonate: The creator of the cannon, if a 9th level artificer (artillerist), can use an action to detonate the cannon when within 60 ft of it, see the attack section.
- Shimmering Field: If the creator of the cannon is a 15th level artificer (artillerist), they and their allies have half cover while within 10 ft of the cannon.
