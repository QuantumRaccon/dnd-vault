## Description
---
_A shadowy figure flickers in and out of view. Its indistinct shape betrays a sylvan ancestry, and its eyes are malevolent blue points of light._

**_Fey Undead_**. A deathwisp is a wraith-like spirit created in the Shadow Realm from the violent death of a shadow fey or evil fey.

**_Rift Walkers_**. Many deathwisps remain among the shadows, but a few enter the natural world through planar rifts and gates, or by walking along shadow roads between the worlds. Retaining only a trace of their former personality and knowledge, their lost kindness has been replaced with malice.

**_Devour Breath_**. A deathwisp feasts on the breath of living things, and invariably seeks to devour animals and solitary intelligent prey. It is quite intelligent and avoids fights against greater numbers.
