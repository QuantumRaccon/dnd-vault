## Description
---
>A hulking figure clad in a black armor adorned with thorny ornaments slowly walks forward, seemingly unhindered by the thick vegetation of the surrounding woods.

Thornheart guardians are unyielding and merciless defenders of the forest domains of hags and other sinister fey. They are the twisted cousins of [[green knight of the woods \|green knights of the woods]] (Creature Codex), and good-aligned fey often send green knights on hunts to destroy thornheart guardians and their creators.
**_Shadow Origins_**. Thornheart guardians are created from the bodies and souls of unfortunate knights who foolishly fell for the charms of hags or dark fey and swore eternal servitude to them. In unholy ceremonies, hags fuse the knights' bodies with armor forged in the Shadow Realm then transform the knights' hearts into a cluster of enchanted thorns.

**_Relentless and Loyal_**. The thornheart guardian is a terror to behold. Once it has found its mark, it doesn't back down until the enemies of its sinister liege have been slain. Its enchanted heart gives it power over the plants around it, and it uses these plants to capture and kill its enemies.

**_Construct Nature_**. The thornheart guardian doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
