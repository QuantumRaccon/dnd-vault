## Description
---
_This large rodent stands upright, wearing a wooden breastplate and gripping a leaf-bladed silver spear. It chitters with menace._

**_Preening Protectors_**. These sleek-furred celestial beings act as the defenders of their kind. Every bit as egotistical as their smaller kin, their fur is always immaculate, and the wooden breastplates they wear often bear intricate carvings of arboreal patterns.

**_Useful Nuisances_**. Though they have gained greater size and strength, ratatosk warlords have lost their connection to the celestial network of other ratatosks. Consequently, they are often found pestering their smaller kin for current news and bits of gossip while exaggerating the protection their greater size provides. The other ratatosks humor this for the most part, though with much sighing.

**_Eager Guardians_**. While most ratatosk are messengers of the gods, many ratatosk warlords claim an even greater purpose: protecting Yggdrasil and the world trees that unite many elements of the cosmos with the realms of the gods and mortals. Their small watchtowers, sprawling tree cities, and portals to particular branches of Yggdrasil maintain a bit of order on the sprawling planar pathways or, in some cases, simply a safe place for a night's rest. However, convincing a ratatosk warlord that a particular traveler is not a servant of darkness is sometimes a quite difficult task; they see danger and demons everywhere.
