## Description
---
_This tree-like creature's hide is charred, cracked, and oozing. A crown of long, branching tentacles set with goat-like eyes encircles a central fanged maw at the top of its bulk. Root-like appendages end in blackened, sooty hooves._

**_Born of Burned Groves_**. During a great scourge that broke the power of a dark goddess' followers and the power of the mages who worshiped her, crusaders destroyed her unholy groves. Her loyal followers and guardians were slain and the groves were razed with holy fire. All the unholy trees of those vile groves burned, as did the profane offspring of the dark goddess. However, not all that were burned died. The strongest of her children lived, and they remain as guardians of those lost places of power. Their might has warped and changed, but it is hardly diminished.


**_Unholy Trees_**. Flame-scourged scions often lurk in their unholy mother's groves in tree form. Where once they would take the shape of living trees, now they appear as leafless, charred husks, to blend in with the hardscrabble nature of these desolate areas.
