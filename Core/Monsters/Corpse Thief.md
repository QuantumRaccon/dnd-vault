## Description
---
_This thin, androgynous creature stands with a noticeable hunch. Its skin is patchy and discolored, and it wears dozens of trinkets on strings around its neck and shoulders._

Unable to feel strong emotion naturally, corpse thieves steal objects from other humanoids, reliving sensations tied to those possessions in an attempt to find some feeling of belonging.

**_Object Reading_**. By holding certain objects, a corpse thief can learn about the item's previous owner. It feels the sensations and emotions tied to the object, and such experiences are usually the only strong feelings it ever experiences in its life. The creature gets its name from its tendency to loot graves for such trinkets, although it is also adept at stealing them in the chaos of a battle.


**_Alien Minds_**. Corpse thieves cannot feel strong emotions such as joy, anger, and love without reading it on an object. They have a weak sense of personal identity, often confusing memories gained through stolen items with their own. A corpse thief that steals too many objects from one individual may start to believe it is that person. Always seeking emotional connection but forever unable to attain it, corpse thieves live in small communities on the edges of humanoid settlements in mock semblances of those humanoids' societies.


**_Unflattering Legends_**. In addition to the unfortunate name others have bestowed upon them, corpse thieves find themselves associated with several ugly myths. Some claim a corpse thief 's discolored patches of skin come from the flesh of humanoid corpses sewn onto its body. Others believe the creatures sometimes disguise themselves as recently deceased humanoids. If somebody makes a miraculous recovery from illness but acts strangely afterward, people may believe the individual is really a corpse thief in disguise.
