## Description
---
>A serpent rises in tight coils, until its head is level with that of a tall man. Its body is thick and covered in glossy black scales broken by wide bands of bright orange. The two smaller serpents growing from its torso wind together and hiss menacingly. Twin rattles shake rapidly behind the creature.

**_Ophidian Masters_**. Shrines to hebi-doku are found most often in places where venomous snakes are common. They are also located in regions where snakes are considered sacred and in the homes and guilds of assassins who favor the use of toxins. Hebi-doku are never found without an accompaniment of other serpents.

**_Feared and Placated_**. Adventurers and archaeologists who travel through snake-filled jungles and ruins offer hebi-doku tribute, hoping that doing so will purchase some protection from the snakes they encounter. Scorned lovers sometimes venerate a local hebi-doku in the hopes that it will poison future relationships for their former paramour. A hebi-doku claims to care little for the veneration of non-serpents, but it knows it will cease to exist without their gifts.

**_Toxic Shrines_**. To summon a hebi-doku, a heart stilled by snake venom must be laid at the foot of a low altar built of mongoose bones. Immortal Spirit Nature. The kami doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

> [!INFO] Hebi-Doku and Yig
>In Midgard, hebi-doku live in close proximity to the snakelike Great Old One Yig and the [[serpentfolk of yig \|serpentfolk]] (Creature Codex) who venerate him. Hebi-doku don't worship Yig, though they respect his power and don't harm his adherents. Yig-worshiping serpentfolk who take action to promote snakes or create areas for snakes to thrive sometimes do so with hebi-doku assistance.
> [!INFO] Kami in Midgard
>Kami are the small gods of the Winter Isles. Each kami is the spirit of something tangible, be it an ideal, an emotion, or a specific item or location. A kami can be summoned to the Material Plane by any creature that builds it a shrine and offers suitable tribute. Less majestic kami, such as a [[gorao-ka]], require only a small shrine and a gift of any size, so long as it is freely given. More important kami may require a magnificent monument as well as some form of grand tribute.
