## Description
---
_This walking corpse's skin is tight against its bones and covered in weeping pustules. Its burial clothes are shredded and tattered at the cuffs and sleeves._

Nachzehrer are undead superficially similar to ghouls and easily mistaken for them at a distance. The giveaway is the multitude of sores and pustules that dot the creature's skin, ready to burst with virulent fluids.

**_Plague Born_**. Nachzehrer arise when plague strikes and kills a large number of people. The first victim of a plague might rise as one of these foul undead, and if that nachzehrer can infect enough victims a second nachzehrer will rise to join the first.

**_Feeds on Life_**. Nachzehrer are driven to feed on the essence of the living. The creature's shadow has a draining effect on living creatures, sapping their strength when it falls across them and leaving them ripe for the nachzehrer's grisly feeding. The creature's grinding teeth drain the life from its victims, while spreading its disease into the victim. Nachzehrer are particularly driven to hunt down and consume their own living family members.

**_Undead Nature_**. A nachzehrer doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
