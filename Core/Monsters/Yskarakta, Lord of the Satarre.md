## Description
---
>The wiry reptilian creature carries itself with a regal bearing. Glowing rings float above its head, their light glinting off its glossy flesh. It wields a long, axe-headed staff crowned with rings.

Yskarakta is a confidante of Nidhoggr, the dragon at the roots of Yggdrasil. He is an intimate friend of the void cults, blood cults, and night-bringers of all stripes. Yskarakta commands legions of [[satarre destroyer \|satarre destroyers]] and [[satarre mystic \|mystics]] with equal glee, and, unlike demons, he can plot and plan and scheme. He portends the end of existence that all satarre long to hasten.
**_True Void Believer_**. Yskarakta exhorts and encourages his followers, void cultists, and others to pursue paths of destruction, death, and decay. At all times he knows the end times draw near, and he seeks omens, prophecies, and lore related to hastening doomsday.

**_Wise and Cunning_**. The Lord of the Satarre weaves plans within plans, and uncovers the weaknesses of foes to better destroy them. He almost always knows a shameful secret, a hidden vulnerability, or a weakness of any person or place he seeks to destroy. Sometimes, Yskarakta manifests these secrets in glyphs that appear above his head.

**_Walker of the World Tree_**. Yskarakta can open shadow roads and planar pathways with ease, and he is often found wandering the planar highways. He occasionally wears a cloak and pretends to be a god of wisdom, or he claims to be a messenger sent directly from some higher power. Yskarakta finds it that much sweeter to sow destruction and confusion when his enemies' guard is lowered.
