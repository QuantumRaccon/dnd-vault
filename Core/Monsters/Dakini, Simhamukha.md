## Description
---
_Those who say that the good and wise are meek and gentle have never seen the simhamuka in her full rage, striking down evil with the fury of a raging lion._

The simhamukha is a dakini of great vengeance and wrath but also of vast enlightenment. It appears as a titanic woman with blue-black skin and the head of a white lion with a golden mane. The lion's face has three yellow or red eyes with the third in the center of its forehead.

**_Manifestations of Energy_**. Dakinis are lesser goddesses that take active roles in the world. They are an embodiment of enlightened awareness and wisdom and seek to help others to achieve a higher state of being. Of the dakinis, the simhamukha is the most wrathful, seeking to punish those who have harmed protected beings.
