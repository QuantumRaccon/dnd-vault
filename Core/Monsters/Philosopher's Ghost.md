## Description
---
_Half fire and half ooze, a philosopher's ghost is a bubbling, burning, highly corrosive creature that can make the tallest tower tumble into ruin—if properly directed._

The result of an alchemical process, a philosopher's ghost can appear as an ooze which glows a faint, eerie green in darkness, or as a vaguely-humanoid, green, sparking flame. It is especially drawn to movement, pursuing moving creatures to the exclusion of all else.

**_Powerful and Difficult to Harness_**. Notoriously difficult to control, the unexpected creation of a philosopher's ghost spells disaster for the alchemist and, in all likelihood, anyone nearby as well. The creature burns its way through wooden structures with great speed, and, over time, even metal is melted by its heat.

**_Alchemical Nightmare_**. Among alchemical circles, the only known remedy for a rampaging philosopher's ghost is complete immersion in water—even then it can spontaneously reignite and wreak further havoc long afterward when exposed to the air again.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A philosopher's ghost doesn't require sleep.
