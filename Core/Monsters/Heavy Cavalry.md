## Description
---
_A dragonborn knight sits astride a giant lizard like a mountain of armor and scales, draped in crimson heraldry. The knight couches its lance on its saddle and begins loading a heavy crossbow._

**_Mounted Soldier_**. Dragonborn heavy cavalry crash through the fields of war like a wall of scales and iron, breaking through enemy lines with the combined might of their lances and the weight of their giant lizard mounts. These mighty warriors also enjoy the privileges of high society as recompense for their military service, instilling most heavy cavaliers with a sort of patriotism, even if it only lasts as long as they receive their promised gold.


> [!INFO] Dragonborn in Midgard
>For most in Midgard, speaking the word dragonborn conjures images of the Mharoti Dragon Empire. They see the armies marching across the fields of their homelands, the wyverns soaring through the skies, the fire raining down upon the earth. To them, dragonborn herald death.
>Most dragonborn resent this, of course. Like any other people, they are not inclined toward evil or good—but those within the Dragon Empire are subject to the sultan's dreams of conquest. Because the Dragon Empire holds scalykind above all other races, intelligent creatures like true dragons, dragonborn, and half‑dragons—even kobolds—receive superior education and martial training to the rest of the empire's peoples.
>These dragonkin often go on to become officers in the Dragon Empire's mighty legions, desiring to amass even more power for themselves by conquering Midgard and the Southlands. Dragonborn elementalists and light cavalry are part of the Dragon Empire's akinji military caste. In peacetime, the akinji are its landholders, merchants, priests, mayors, headmen, ship captains, and minor figures, filling a role similar to landed gentry elsewhere. Dragonborn heavy cavalry within the empire are part of the timarli military caste, which is comprised entirely of minor nobles, generals, and ambassadors. Many dragonborn heavy cavalry serve the sultan directly as advisors, castellans, seers, or spies.
