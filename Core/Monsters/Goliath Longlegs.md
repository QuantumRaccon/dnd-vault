## Description
---
_A spider the size of a large house, with legs that could pass for trees, moves through the forest._

Solitary hunters, goliath longlegs sit motionless for long periods of time, waiting for unsuspecting prey to walk beneath them.

**_Stealthy Ambush Predators_**. The legs of a goliath longlegs mimic the size and texture of the trees of the forest in which it resides. It uses this natural camouflage to its advantage, hiding its body in the crowns of the nearby trees.


**_Venomous Weapons_**. The goliath longlegs' legs are vulnerable to attack, so it prefers to poison its prey with a paralyzing nerve agent.


**_Unknown Origin_**. Not much is known about the origin of this species. They are few in number, and, when one is discovered, word rarely gets back to civilization.
