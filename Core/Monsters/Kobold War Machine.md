## Description
---
>A fire burns in the maw of the massive, draconic machine. The frenetic cackling of kobolds yelling orders to one another echoes from the interior, rising above the sounds of the machine's engines.

Inspired by the sight of a fearsome [[one-headed clockwork dragon \|clockwork dragon]] (Creature Codex), some kobolds with an understanding of engineering came together and forged their own dragon-like weapon of great power. Kobolds feel unstoppable when a war machine rolls along beside them, leading them to take bolder (and often more successful), risks.
**_Hard to Operate_**. The kobold war machine is normally manned by three kobolds. Though the machine is a marvel of kobold engineering, it is difficult to control, and its smooth operation is impaired by the contanct bickering of its crew just as often as by it unstable construction.

**_Draconic Machine_**. By some quirk of its creation, the kobold war machine exhibits some draconic personality traits. It moves better when diving into a fight or when pursuing treasure, and it rarely has issues when handled by an operator who regularly praises it in front of others. Conversely, it is slow to respond when directed to retreat.

**_Construct Nature_**. The kobold war machine doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
