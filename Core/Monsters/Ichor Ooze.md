>Black sludge with glowing red veins seeps out of a crack in the wall, sizzling as it pushes forward.

Ichor oozes are vengeful slimes created by the destruction of fiends.
**_Born from Destroyed Fiends_**. When a fiend is destroyed on a plane of existence other than its home plane, ichor is all that remains in the place where it was slain. When a strong-willed, hateful fiend dies cursing its slayers, a small piece of its lust for vengeance can infuse the ichor, giving the remains life. The ichor becomes one or more ichor oozes, which have a single-minded goal: revenge.

**_Revenge Seekers_**. Ichor oozes stop at nothing to hunt down the people who killed the fiends that created them. They can sense their quarries over any distance and attack other life they come across to fuel their pursuits. The destruction of a bigger fiend, like a [[balor]], can result in many ichor oozes pursuing a single target. Once an ichor ooze has its revenge, it goes on a rampage, killing all life it can find until it is destroyed.

**_Ooze Nature_**. An ichor ooze doesn't require sleep.
