## Description
---
_The skeletal figure draped in fine robes lifts its lantern, illuminating the area in a sickly light._

Spirit lamps are cursed creatures carrying lanterns that trap the souls of their victims and unleash those souls to ravage the living.

**_Descent Into Madness_**. A living creature that touches the lantern is cursed, unable to release it and unable to see except in the lantern's light. Torn between fear of the darkness and the horrors it sees in the cursed light, the bearer is soon driven mad. Over time the bearer twists into the skeletal spirit lamp.

**_Undead Nature_**. The spirit lamp doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
