## Description
---
_An aura of power, centered on a glowing purple crystal atop a short staff, crackles around this pale kobold and arcs across the horns on its headdress. A luminous, leering dragon face fades into being, ghostly and terrible, behind it._

Wizard kobolds are among the most cunning and intelligent of the scaly kin. They turn their talent for manipulating arcane magic to study and formula, often getting their start with a stolen spellbook, or one purloined from the remains of an adventurer who met its end in a kobold trap.

**_Draconic Channel_**. Wizard kobolds have made a fearsome reputation for themselves with their ability to tap into their draconic heritage through their magic. The wizard draws magic either from a patron dragon or an ancestral dragon figure, manifesting it as a magical effigy. This apparition lends its resilience to the wizard and brings terror and death to the kobold's enemies.
