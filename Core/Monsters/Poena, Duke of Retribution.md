## Description
---
>The fiendish beauty descends on dark wings, her eyes glittering with malice.

**_Champion of Revenge_**. Poena lives to harvest the souls of those who have done violence to others. In particular, she targets individuals who commit harm to children, domestic violence, or sexual assault. Victims of such crimes can call upon Poena and her servants to punish those that plague them.

**_Mother of Erinyes_**. Poena corrupted the angels who would become the [[erinyes]], her singleminded drive to punish murderers and abusers appealing to them. Poena is attended by a band of nine female erinyes "muses."

**_Action Over Words_**. Poena is consumed by her quest for vengeance, and she frequently forgets to participate in devil politics. While her wrath can be troublesome, she is widely disregarded by other devils.
