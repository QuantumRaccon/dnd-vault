## Description
---
>A choking cackle escapes the throat of the hyena. As it steps forward, patches of fur fall off of it, revealing bone and rotting muscle.

As their name implies, emperor's hyenas are undead hyenas that have been magically enhanced and tied to the emperor of the ghouls. With rotting, matted fur, missing teeth, and baleful yellow eyes, they are easily mistaken for simple undead beasts. Their appearance belies a relentless cunning.

**_Gifts from the God of Death_**. The method of creation of emperor's hyenas was a gift given directly to the ghoul emperor by the god of death and has been entrusted to only a few necromancers. Emperor's hyenas can be created only from hyenas that were anointed protectors of the god's holy places when they were alive. Their scarcity means they are primarily used as messengers and guardians for the emperor. The emperor rarely sends them to attack enemies unless the enemy has truly angered him. The emperor of the ghouls is seldom seen without a pair of emperor's hyenas by his side. When he moves publicly, every available emperor's hyena is deployed to ensure his safety.

**_Voice of the Emperor_**. Emperor's hyenas often deliver messages when the emperor needs a messenger hardier than a [[Ghoul Bat]]. Though the hyenas are incapable of speaking on their own, the emperor can whisper a message into the ear of an emperor's hyena, and the hyena can speak the message in the emperor's own voice.

**_Undead Nature_**. An emperor's hyena doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
