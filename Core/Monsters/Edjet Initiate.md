## Description
---
>Glaring about in brazen challenge to any that would meet its eyes, this elite dragonborn warrior searches for its next target. Adorned in padded armor, its clawed hand never ventures far from the hilt of its sword.

**_True Believers_**. Edjet initiates display all of the fanaticism of the elite [[edjet]] (Creature Codex), but they have yet to develop their precision and poise on the battlefield. Rarely will edjet initiates be turned aside by fear of deathâ€”failure is a much more fearsome prospect.

**_Ready to Impress_**. Before edjet initiates can join the ranks of the edjet corps, they must first prove themselves in battle. This desire often leads them to take great risks on the battlefield, but edjet officers view this process as the natural means to separate those with the will and skill to become true edjet from those that merely aspire to such. Those initiates that are not killed in the course of their training, but that otherwise fail to meet edjet standards, often settle into a lesser role in the military machine as scouts, archers, or other auxiliaries.
