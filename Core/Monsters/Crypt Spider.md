## Description
---
_A black and red spider chitters with excitement as a nearby corpse erupts with a dozen hatchlings._

A crypt spider is an intelligent arachnid with a red body and black abdomen. Females are distinctly larger than males.

**_Graveyard Lurkers_**. Crypt spiders make their homes in crypts, graveyards, and other locations where dead bodies are plentiful. They are blessed by dark gods of undeath, and create and control undead through power granted by the blessing. 

**_Horrifying Familial Bonds_**. Crypt spiders usually gather in mated pairs with a larger female dominating a smaller male. In desperate times, males become food for crypt-spider young. Once mated, the female lays her eggs in the bodies of their prey, where the brood mature by feeding on the creatures' fluids and each other. Those that survive into adulthood "hatch" from the corpse in a horrifying display.

**_Social Creatures_**. Crypt spiders contact other crypt spiders to share unique catches, trading them like fine wines. While they can eat any creature, crypt spiders find humans, dwarves, and elves the most appetizing.
