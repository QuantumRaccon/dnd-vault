## Description
---
>The large creature lumbers forward, its ape-like and insectoid features blending incomprehensibly. It blinks in and out of existence, closing in on prey in a manner that betrays both the eye and time itself.

Solitary and efficient hunters, dimensional shamblers often materialize in closed structures to surprise prey that believes it is safely hidden. Capable of seeing into and entering the Lower Planes, they regularly stalk targets in the Material Plane by hopping in and out of other planes to remain undetectable.
**_Disturbing Form_**. The dimensional shambler has a rudimentary face with dead eyes, thick hide, and symetrical hands. Its claw-tipped fingers bend in either direction. Moving through many dimensions, the creature's disturbing gait suggests a lack of any conventional skeletal structure.

**_Unknown Origins_**. The number and lifecycle of these creatures is unknown. No records of more than one shambler appearing in the Material Plane at one time exist, and it is not clear whether they were created by some dark or inscrutable power or evolved naturally.
