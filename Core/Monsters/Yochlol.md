## Description
---


The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A yochlol has a 50 percent chance of summoning one yochlol.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
