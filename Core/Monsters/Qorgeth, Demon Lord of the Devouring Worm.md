## Description
---
Qorgeth, the Writhing Prince, Pale Maw, the Devourer, is lord of worms and decay, a massive undulating form that crushes trees and cracks stone. Its presence seeps into the world of mortals via the trails of worms and maggots through rotting flesh. The demon lord views all things that live, or once lived, as its property in the making. Everything becomes its food eventually.

An impossibly massive, pale-fleshed worm, Qorgeth's segmented body is road-mapped with pale veins of pink and blue. When it opens its massive maw, it reveals a writhing mass of smaller worms, many of which are adorned with wailing or enraged humanoid heads.

**_Demon Lords_**. Demonic powers swarm throughout the lower planes without number. Ancient beasts fade from mortal history, only to reappear eons later when their schemes draw them back to the Material Plane.
**_Qorgeth's Lair_**. Qorgeth's lair is a tangled labyrinth of tunnels in the heart of its dark realm. The tunnels seem to twist and burrow through space itself rather than just the rock and soil surrounding them.
