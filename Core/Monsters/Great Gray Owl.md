## Description
---
Great gray owls are stealthy predators, and the largest of the non-giant varieties of owls. Unlike other owls, great grays aren't territorial—with the exception of females raising young—and don't flush or spook when other creatures approach. Rather, they remain still on their low perches, often going overlooked.
