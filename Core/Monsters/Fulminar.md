## Description
---
_What seemed to be a storm cloud takes the shape of a feline predator. Flashes of lightning course through its semisolid body as it strikes with overwhelming speed._

**_Aerial Felines_**. Fulminars are creatures composed of semisolid elemental matter and roughly shaped like large feline predators.


**_Cloud Giant Allies_**. Fulminars were either created or first summoned by powerful cloud giant sorcerers. They can also be found in the company of djinnis, silver dragons, and other creatures strongly connected to the element of air. It is unclear whether they have their own motives or are directed by a higher, elemental power.


**_Lightning-Fast Slayers_**. Thanks to their speed, stealth, and a strange magical ability to entrap creatures with shackles of lightning, fulminars are extremely versatile, serving as spies, assassins, and shock troops.


**_Elemental Nature_**. A fulminar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
