## Description
---
>The smell of freshly turned soil and bubbling sulfur accompanies this terrible monster, an amalgam of wood and flesh vaguely reminiscent of a giant centaur with bony wooden limbs. Vast draconic wings sprout from the creature's back, and it bears a serpentine tail ending in a cone-shaped rattle.

**_Born of Dragons_**. When a particularly hardy [[child of Yggdrasil]] (Creature Codex) comes across the still-fresh corpse of an adult or older dragon, it attempts to devour the dragon's heart and metamorphose into a larger and more vicious aberration known as a forest emperor. This process takes one week, and, while transforming, the child of Yggdrasil spins a thick green cocoon of acidic vines around itself. When the forest emperor finally emerges, it is close to starving and attacks and devours any creature that comes within reach of its terrible, gnarled limbs.

**_Continually Growing_**. Forest emperors never stop growing, and specimens of gargantuan size have been found residing in the most desolate and treacherous forests and mountains, often in the lairs of dragons they have consumed. Unusually powerful forest emperors have even made it as far as the tangled roots of the World Tree itself, spending their time communing with evil fey spirits and the terrible serpents said to twine about its boughs.
