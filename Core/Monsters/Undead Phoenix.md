## Description
---
_This huge winged creature is surrounded by a dark purple aura like a slick, greasy fog. The flesh and feathers of the bird fall away in oozing lumps, as if it is in a perpetual state of decay._

**_The Antithesis of Rebirth_**. The phoenix is a fiery symbol of hope, rebirth, renewal, and the inspiring resilience of life. The undead phoenix is the antithesis of that: a symbol of death, decay, rot, and the relentless crush of death. The creature appears as a large bird surrounded by a swirling aura of purple-black vapors. Within the vile fog, the undead phoenix's physical form is in a constant state of decay: molting feathers, oozing flesh, dripping blood, and exposed bones. 

**_Corrupted Creation_**.  The undead phoenix is "born" when a typical phoenix dies at the hands of an undead creature that creates new undead: vampires, wraiths, wights, and the like. Liches sometimes arrange the creation of an undead phoenix to use them as mounts. Phoenixes succumbing to undeath rot away to nothing in a matter of seconds, leaving only a pile of foul, rotting goo. Moments later, the putrid ooze explodes as the undead phoenix slithers out of the substance in its new form. 

**_Spreader of Decay_**. The undead phoenix is often a harbinger of death through disease, plague, or famine. Its aura invites sickness and rot in anyone unfortunate enough to get close. Its malignant beak spreads its decay, making natural or magical recuperation impossible.

**_Undead Nature_**. The undead phoenix doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
