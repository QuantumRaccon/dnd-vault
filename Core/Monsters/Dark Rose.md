## Description
---
A dark rose is a huge, bloated plant filled with demonic corruption. It sprawls throughout gardens taking on a life of its own and eating any fleshy creatures that stray too close. Its thick, thorny vines snake their way throughout the place, leading back to a swollen blood-red flower head filled with teeth.

**_Demonic Incursion_**. When a powerful demon or demon lord wishes to corrupt the Material Plane, they have a huge variety of ways in which to do so. Many demon lords can send literal demons from the Abyss, but some prefer to corrupt what is already present on the Material Plane. The dark rose is an example of this, where a powerful demon, such as Zuggtmoy or Demogorgon, has tainted a rose garden with their abyssal magic.
**_Flailing Tendrils_**. The dark rose appears as a thicket of flailing, thorny tendrils, topped by a blood red rose, which often drips with the blood of its victims. These tendrils make it extremely difficult to attack the main body of the plant as getting close will inevitably result in being slashed to pieces by the vicious thorns. Not only this, but the dark rose can grapple creatures, pick them up and throw them around.
