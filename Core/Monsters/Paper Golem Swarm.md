## Description
---
_A seemingly ordinary piece of paper leaps to life and lashes out with its sharp edges._

**_Reams of Danger_**. Though a single paper golem can protect the spellbooks of paranoid spellcasters, it is far more formidable when in the form of a swarm.


**_Protector of Secrets_**. Once the paper golem has been created, it patiently lies in wait, dormant until an unsuspecting creature happens upon it.

**_Poisoned Manuscripts_**. The ink of the paper golem is imbued with magic, creating a toxin to use against its victims.

**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
