## Description
---
This severe elf has pale, almost white skin and tightly braided blond hair. Her gown is exquisite, fashioned of luminous blue fabric that catches light and shines from within. Lacy ice crystals accent the gown, and a snow-white mantle cascades from her shoulders. Icicles radiate in a crownlike halo behind her head, drifting gracefully through the air.

Her Crystalline Majesty, Morrinn of Grokeheim, is the coldhearted Snow Queen, Daughter of Boreas. The Snow Queen rules a northern kingdom in the Frozen Reach. Perpetually shrouded in snow and ice, her domain is inhospitable to outsiders. She rules from Grokeheim, a castle of delicate spires carved entirely out of ice. The dwelling catches and reflects even the faintest glimmer of light, shining like a beacon and enticing travelers to risk the dangerous winter realm.

**_Queen of Giants_**. The Snow Queen is proud and cruel to any who cross her. Her daughters, the ice maidens, roam her kingdom with ease. Travelers who can't give a good reason to be moving through the Queen's territory meet a quick end in their chilly embrace.
Morinn commands the loyalty of winter-born tribes of fraughashar, ogres, frost giants, thursir giants, and trollkin. She is said to have mocked both Thor and Loki, and to often lead their priests astray into winter storms.


**_Fey Lords and Ladies_**. Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings, but despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.
**_Heads of State_**. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's rule, in his or eyes, a fey ruler's word is law, and so shall the rest of the world see it! Outsiders may not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

**_Circles of Power_**. Each fey noble is supreme in his or her own bailiwick, and the rulers maintain a rigid hierarchy among themselves. Thee Queen of Night and Magic is undeniably the most powerful of all fey nobles, and she rules cyclically with her embittered husband, the Moonlit King. Together, the Summer and Winter monarchs rule over the entire shadow fey race. Thee River King is next in power, and he rules over the river elves of the Arbonesse forest. Thee Snow Queen rules among the ice, snow, and plundering reavers of the far north, as wells as commanding the obedience of the [[fraughashar]] and [[ice maiden \|ice maidens]]. The Bear King, the weakest politically, rules a northerly city-state where [[werebear \|werebears]] are common and mead flows like water.
Thee odd man out is the Lord of the Hunt. Though he is associated with both the shadow fey and the light elves, no one is certain of his true identity or how he fits into the political structure of fey nobility. Because he seldom concerns himself with politics, few have felt any need to press the question.
Other fey courts and rulers certainly exist, though their rulers are more esoteric than those described here.

**_Vacant Thrones_**. When a lord or lady dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the station of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.


> [!INFO] Touch of Iron
>Lords and ladies of the fey courts are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats. A universal exception to this is weapons of cold-wrought iron. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh. A cold iron weapon is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies.
>Cold iron weapons, however, are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficult—and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.

**_Snow Queen's Lair_**. The ice castle of Grokeheim is the Snow Queen's lair. Sunlight and moonlight flash through the delicate spires and translucent walls, setting the palace agleam even in the deepest night. The castle reflects its mistress: beautiful, cold, and unforgivingly deadly.
