## Description
---
The colossus is a weapon of elemental destruction created by the proto-gods in a bid for power over a realm where magic flowed raw, unbridled, and unchecked. Standing nearly forty feet tall when on its feet, the colossus dwarfs modern-day giants and is rivaled only by the sheer size of the tarrasque. The bipedal tower has a natural armor that resembles a mountainous landscape and gives off its own magnetic aura. As the gods settled into their portfolios, the need for these beings passed and they soon fell into obscurity. This bound specimen may very well be the last one in existence.

**_Forgotten Master_**. Although it is not clear why the colossus is bound to its location, tomes of old purport of a malicious wizard who may be the cause. Ancient scribes sought to omit his name, letting it fade into the annals of history, but do tell of a unique gemstone created through what must be a powerful variant of the imprisonment spell. Nicknamed "Maximilian" by the unlikeable master, the colossus served him as it did the gods; as a weapon. When the time came for the wizard to pass on, it was thought best for the realm if the weapon was put to rest alongside him.
**_Earthen Grasp_**. Spellcasters that know the spell Maximilian's Earthen Grasp regularly pay homage to this being, though not in the way they would expect. As the books tell, Maximilian was not pleased to be the puppet of a mere wizard and often attempted to reach out for the gemstone that kept the elemental in its prison. Though it seems unlikely, the legends state that the hand that bursts forth as a result of the casting of this spell is actually the hand of Maximilian, still in search of that gemstone. As the creator of Maximilian's Earthen Grasp, that was the wizard's legacy, the eternal taunting of a planar weapon. How foolish...
