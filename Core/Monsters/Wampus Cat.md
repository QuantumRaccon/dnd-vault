## Description
---
_A raven-haired young woman rises to the surface of the water as she swims, singing softly to herselfâ€”and her lower body is that of a mountain lion. Her sweet song turns to a yowl of rage when she spots prey._

Wampus cats are all born from an ancient shaman's curse. Trollkin, orc, goblin, and human shamans alike all claim to be able to transform those who practice forbidden magic into wampus cats.

**_Forest Streams_**. The wampus cat stalks the shores of woodland waterways, using her magic to disguise her true form and lure unsuspecting victims to the water's edge. She is particularly fond of attacking bathers or those pulling water from a stream.

**_Hatred of the Holy_**. While she prefers to feast on intelligent male humanoids, she holds a special animosity toward and hunger for holy men of any kind. Unless near starvation or if provoked, however, she will not kill women. Indeed, a wampus cat may strike up a temporary friendship with any woman who is having difficulties with men, though these friendships typically last only as long as their mutual enemies live. Some witches are said to command gain their trust and keep them as companions.

**_Swamp Team Ups_**. Will-o'-wisps and miremals enjoy working in tandem with wampus cats; the wisps alter their light to mimic the flicker of a torch or candle and illuminate the disguised cat, the better to lure in victims, then assist the cat in the ensuing battle. Miremals use a tall story to lure travelers into a swamp when the hour grows late, then abandon them.
