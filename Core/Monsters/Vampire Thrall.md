## Description
---
_Servants and lackeys of vampires, vampire thralls receive blood from their masters' veins periodically, granting them a number of benefits so long as they continue to receive their masters' blood._

Vampire thralls are not themselves undead, though many are hopeful they soon will be. Ingesting humanoid blood is in no way beneficial to a thrall, but this fact has not prevented many from trying.
