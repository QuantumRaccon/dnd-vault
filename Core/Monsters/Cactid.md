## Description
---
_Rootlike tendrils explode from the sand at the base of this tall cactus bristling with needles. It uses its tendrils to reach for prey._

**_Needled Sentients_**. Cactids are semi-sentient cacti that grow in a myriad of shapes and sizes, from ground-hugging barrels and spheroid clumps that pin their victims to the ground to towering saguaros with clublike arms that yank victims off their feet. Most cactids are green or brown with distinct ribs; all are lined with countless needles.

**_Drain Fluids_**. In addition to gathering water, a cactid's tendril-roots can snag nearby creatures and pull them into a deadly embrace. Once a creature is pinned, the cactid's spines siphon off the victim's bodily fluids, until little but a dried husk remains. Many cactids are adorned with bright flowers or succulent fruit to lure prey into reach. Some scatter shiny objects within reach to attract sentient creatures. For those traveling the desert, however, a cactid's greatest treasure is the water stored within its flesh. A slain cactid's body yields four gallons of water with a successful DC 15 Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check. Failure indicates that only one gallon is recovered.

**_Slow Packs_**. Cactids were created by a nomadic sect of druids, but their original purpose is lost. They have limited mobility, so they often congregate in stands or to travel together in a pack to better hunting grounds.
