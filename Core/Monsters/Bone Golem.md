## Description
---
_The creature moves with a strange grace despite the motley collection of bones that comprise its form._

**_A Lesser Golem_**. Upon seeing the gangly form of a bone golem, even experienced adventurers assume the terrible creature is the work of a necromancer. In reality, however, the creature is a construct, a golem in the same vein as a flesh or clay golem.


**_Ghoul Servant_**. The art of crafting a golem from the bones of the fallen has been mastered by advanced clans or even nations of ghouls. After noticing the fragility of their animated skeletons, they undertook the study of construct magic to create the hardier and more resilient bone golems. These constructs are often sent on patrols with ghoul rangers to provide martial support.


**_Construct in Undead Clothing_**. The ghoul arcanists who create bone golems do their best to disguise their creations as typical skeletons, hoping to fool wielders of divine might into wasting resources often used against real undead. In battle, a DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check is needed to determine the creature is a construct and not an undead.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
