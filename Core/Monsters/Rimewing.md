## Description
---
_The wings of this giant moth resemble a stunningly complex snowflake. Its long icicle-shaped antennae click and clatter as it flies across the snowy northern woods._

**_Captivating_**. Rimewings are prized for their wings, which feature a magically compelling pattern and coloration. They are found in cold and snow-covered climes, where they use their magic to draw in prey.
