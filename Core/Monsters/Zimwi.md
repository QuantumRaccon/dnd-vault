## Description
---
_This swift-moving, lanky humanoid has long arms ending in wicked claws and jaws that open impossibly wide._

**_Swift as Horses_**. Distantly related to the trolls, the swift and nimble zimwi are a plague upon southern lands. Constantly hungry and ill-tempered, with the speed to run down horses, lone zimwi have been known to attack large caravans.

**_Always Starving_**. Most of their attacks are driven by hunger. The stomach of a zimwi is larger than its body, extending extra-dimensionally and driving the zimwi nearly insane with the constant sensation of emptiness, as though it is starving to death. Because of their endless hunger and low intelligence, zimwi have little awareness of the course of a battle. Losing means only that they have not eaten. As long as they continue to feast, they fight on, feeling victorious until death comes to them or all of their prey.

**_Stomachs of Holding_**. The mage-crafters discovered the secret to turning zimwi stomachs into extradimensional containers similar to [[bag of holding \|bags of holdings]]. Using a zimwi stomach in the creation of such items reduces the cost of materials by half.
