## Description
---
The various scorpion cults train their believers in the arts of death. Few of their proselytes survive the initiation, but those who do emerge from their trials as assassins of unparalleled skill. Through the worship of their god, scorpion assassins cleanse their souls of emotion and their bodies of warmth. Countless rumors surround the death cult. It is said that a scorpion assassin's heart does not beat and that they stand always on the precipice of life and death. Others say that the assassins are living, but their mortal souls have been excised, and their bodies become vessels for gods of death. Others still claim they were never alive and are celestial reapers sent to usher mortals to their final judgment.
