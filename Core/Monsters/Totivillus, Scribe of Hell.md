## Description
---
This unassuming man has walnut-colored skin and small horns, and he wears a simple, gray scribe's robe. Evil in Triplicate. Devils track everything, and therein lies the difference between the creatures of demonkind and the creatures of the Nine Hells. The devil responsible for all pacts, soul-stealing contracts, and documents signed in blood is Totivillus, who also creates errors in sacred scrolls and who encourages nodding scribes to drift to sleep and ruin a fresh page of vellum.

**_Serves Mammon_**. To all outward appearances, Totivillus is the most powerful servant of the Archduke Mammon, though in the infernal chain of command his immediate superior is Duke Berith, the Duke of False Coins and the Master of Accounts. To the unbiased eye, Totivillus is at least as powerful as Duke Berith, and some believe he rivals Mammon himself. However, this is not reflected in public or even in the confidential lists of Hell's feudal order. Totivillus is a sort of hidden archduke, and that is the way he prefers to operate, shielded by reams of paper and ranks of intermediaries.

**_Humble Appearance_**. Totivillus is a baron, but unlike most of the princes of Hell, he does not appear wealthy, powerful, or even outwardly malignant. His simple robe seems gray from a distance, but on close inspection it is actually a white garment woven with tiny letters that describe his history and deeds in the Infernal tongue.

> [!INFO] The Baron's True Name
>Depending on your group of players, it might or might not be worth using the baron's true name: Titivillus. Pronounced at the table, it's likely to reduce grown men to giggles, but that might prove worthwhile as no arch-devil can stand to be laughed at. Perhaps this is why Totivillus maintains a low profile and works his evil in paper and ink?


**_Arch-Devils_**. The rulers of Hell are the arch-devils, some arch-dukes and princes, others mere baronsâ€”but all with great longing to advance themselves and seize power.
