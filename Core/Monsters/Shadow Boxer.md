## Description
---
>The shadow caught the man's eye. It looked and moved like a house cat, but there was no animal present to cast it. He followed the shadow as it moved along the wall then transferred to the ground, not noticing the distortion of light behind him. The last thing he heard as the invisible feline tore out his throat was a contented purr.

**_Finicky Spirits_**. Shadow boxers are the physical manifestation of feline collective memory. They are found in urban areas and other places people congregate. Like other fey, they desire to be placated by mortals, and they allow their presence to be detected to induce people to leave them gifts. A shadow boxer develops relationships with one household at a time and protects it. Households that don't leave sufficient tribute or that cease offering it gifts entirely swiftly find their members targeted by the slighted fey.

**_Council of Cats_**. When they sleep, shadow boxers share dreams with all mundane cats and other shadow boxers within a mile. Within the dream, the cats and the shadow boxer gambol and roughhouse while they share information. Many capers and activities are planned during these dream sessions, and seeing a large clowder of cats getting along is a sign that a shadow boxer in the area has a game afoot. Shadow boxers despise creatures, such as [[heggarna]], that use the "good name" of cats to harm others or spread fear. They feel a mixture of pity and disgust for [[yowler \|yowlers]] and destroy the undead whenever the two meet.

**_Lords of the Hunt_**. Shadow boxer legends state that larger shadow boxers roam the wild parts of the world. These greater kin are more like the large jungle cats they live alongside than the more common city-based shadow boxers.
