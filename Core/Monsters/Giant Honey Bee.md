## Description
---
Giant honey bees congregate in great swarms and fill hollows in rocky hillsides with their massive wax and honey hives. Far more intelligent than their diminutive cousins, giant honey bees sometimes enter into relationships with [[bearfolk]] (Tome of Beasts) or other creatures who can help protect the hive in exchange for a small share of the bees' honey. Unlike a normal honey bee, a giant honey bee who stings a creature doesn't lose its stinger.
Giant honey bees are rarely idle, often moving in elaborate, waggling dances of spirals and loops. This "dance" is actually a complex language the bees use to share staggeringly accurate directions and information about nearby threats and food sources with the rest of their hive.

> [!INFO] Bee Dance Language
>A character who has established peaceful contact with giant honey bees can learn Bee Dance as a language as outlined in the [[downtime activity  training \|downtime rules]].
>While any character who learns it can understand [[Bee Dance]], a creature other than a giant honey bee can only convey basic concepts. A character who assumes the shape of a giant honey bee can communicate fully using the language
