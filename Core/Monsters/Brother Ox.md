## Description
---
_Clad in a simple, plain robe, this creature has the head of a massive ox with wide, sweeping horns and short, dark fur covering its powerfully-muscled body. It stands as still as a statue on one of its feet with the other braced against its opposite knee. The only sound it makes is the deep, rhythmic rush of its breath._

Of all the animal lords, Brother Ox is the most contemplative, and the least likely to act despite his great power. He stands over fifteen feet tall, is strong enough to crush boulders, and moves like grass in the wind. He smells faintly of musk and incense and wears simple, homespun clothing without embellishments or adornments. His only possession is a string of wooden prayer beads. If he ever had a name other than Brother Ox, no one living remembers it and Brother Ox himself isn't telling.
**_Endless Contemplation_**. Brother Ox lives atop the tallest mountain where the air is thin and bitter cold, filling his days with training, study, and contemplation to hone his physical and spiritual being. Despite the simple collection of books and scrolls he keeps, Brother Ox has gathered more knowledge than mortal scholars could dream. Chances are good that if a supplicant can reach Brother Ox, and convince him to help, there is almost no secret he can't uncover.

**_Enigmatic Guide_**. Despite his vast, potentially endless, well of knowledge, Brother Ox isn't motivated to hand these pearls of wisdom out to anyone who asks. However, he has accepted the presence of the occasional pilgrim, and rarely, takes a yakirian (see page 390) or other supplicant as a long‑term student. Brother Ox is difficult to read and hasn't lost his composure in centuries. If a would-be knowledge‑seeker can survive the mountain journey and successfully locate the monastery, it might have to wait weeks or even years for Brother Ox to acknowledge its presence. Then he moves only to set the supplicant on a series of strange, menial, dangerous, or perplexing tasks before granting a request.

**_Timeless Nature_**. Brother Ox doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.


**_Brother Ox's Lair_**. Brother Ox's lair is a sprawling, stone monastery atop one of the tallest mountains in the world. The temple's interior is simply appointed and comfortable even for creatures not acclimated to life at extreme altitude. It contains a rock garden, martial arts practice areas, meditation chambers, a library of scrolls, sparse sleeping quarters with simple food and water, and a shrine dedicated to no particular gods.
**_Animal Lords_**. While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in celestial councils. The [[Queen of Serpents]] speaks to the gods of the desert, and the [[Queen of Birds]] holds a wide swath of territory with eyes drifting gently on updrafts throughout the world. Each animal lord sees and communicates with the members of its species in some mysterious and unknowable fashion. News from the granaries and the kitchens always finds its way to the [[Mouse King \|Mouse King's]] ears, and news from fields of battle or of wheat inevitably lands in the remote nest of the [[Lord of Vultures]].
What do the animal lords do with their legions and their vast array of information? Some sages believe they trade this to other figures, demon and angel alike, in exchange for favors understood best as celestial currency. Others say that they merely inform their followers of dangers to avoid, rich prey to hunt, or similar concerns. In many cases, the animal lords find they have both the time and inclination to meddle occasionally in the affairs of humanoids, especially those who are particularly kind or unusually cruel to their followers.
As a group, the animal lords look after their own, and they defend their territory and their wellsprings of power against humanoid encroachment. The great argument among the animal lords themselves is whether to align themselves with the humanoid world (as the [[Queen of Cats]] and, to some degree, the [[Mouse King]] have done) or to remain outside of it (as the others have).
