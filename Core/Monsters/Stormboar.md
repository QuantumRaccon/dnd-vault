## Description
---
>A massive, green-scaled boar snorts angrily as tiny bolts of blue lightning ripple over its body.

**_Accidental Arcane Creations_**. An [[evoker]] who raised hogs to fund their wild experiments, accidentally blew up their tower years ago. The explosion created a horrific storm that raged for days in the region, causing the locals to take shelter. When the storm dissipated, the wizard and their tower were gone, but the hogs had been transformed into scaled beasts that harnessed the power of lightning and thunder.

**_Storm's Fury_**. Stormboars embody the fury of the storm. Just as stubborn and ferocious as their more mundane cousins, stormboars let no obstacle get in their way while they look for food or protect their offspring. Seasoned hunters know to drop an offering of metal behind as they leave the area to ensure the boar is too distracted to follow them.

**_Metal Devourers_**. Stormboars crave metal. Prospectors track the boars to find areas rich with precious minerals and ore, and treasure hunters use the creatures to sniff out hidden vaults of wealth. Anyone relying on a stormboar must be careful, however. The boars see any creature wearing or carrying metal as the deliverer of an easy meal. The aggressive creatures won't stop attacking until they've consumed every bit of metal an unfortunate traveler is carrying. Starving stormboars have been known to venture into civilized areas for a meal.
