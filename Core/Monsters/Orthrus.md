## Description
---
_A vicious snarl and a low growl issue from the two-headed pinscher. As both sets of lips curl back, the canine crouches and raises its tail, revealing a hissing serpent's head._

An orthrus is a loyal, two-headed guard dog with a serpent for a tail. The creatures are smarter than the average canine and have an innate ferocity that keeps them fighting until the bitter end.

**_Named for a Queen_**. The first orthruses were bred by a sorcerer queen of the same name to be palace guardians. She bred into the dogs an undying loyalty to the owner that raises them. Though she has long since died, her legacy lives on in the breed. Orthruses form monogamous pairs that only mate every few years and produce a brood of one or two pups, making them extremely rare. The combat prowess, rarity, and loyalty of orthruses make them an expensive, sought after breed.

**_Loyal Guardians_**. Orthruses normally follow directives to the letter but their above-animal intelligence allows them some level of critical thinking, adaptation, and interpretation. They are the favored guardians of mages, wealthy nobles, and merchants who have plenty to protect. Some farmers save their copper pieces to buy an orthrus to protect livestock from predators while bandits and other criminals steal to acquire orthrus pups.

**_Three Heads in Harmony_**. An orthrus has three heads but one mind. All of the canine's brains work together so it moves with a fluid grace. The heads of an orthrus never snap, hiss, or growl at each other. They understand that only one head needs to eat and breathe to benefit the entire creature.
