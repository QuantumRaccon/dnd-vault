## Description
---
_The large humanoid form emerging from the treeline reveals itself to not be humanoid at all but a shambling of thick, ropy vines. Within the intertwined plants are bits of armor, broken weapons, and bleached bones._

**_Born of Blood and Battle_**.  Vines of Nemthyr are born at the sites of bloody battles, where two armies leave the ground seeping with ichor and littered with the tools of war. As the plant life in the area soaks up both the physical remains and the psychic trauma of the deadly battle, vines of Nemthyr arise.

**_A Walking Mass Grave_**.  When the vines have soaked up enough death, they can merge into a single creature made of entwined vines, leafy plants, dangerous thorns, and blood-red flowers. This creature also incorporates the remnants of the battle that formed it: fragments of sundered armor, bloodied weapons, severed limbs, broken bones, rotting flesh, etc. To the untrained eye, this amalgam often looks like an undead monstrosity rather than a plant.

**_A Relentless Hunger_**.  The vines of Nemthyr, once formed, has one driving motivation: feed on further carnage. It seeks out sites of mass battles, and, if it can't find those, it seeks out living creatures in the hopes of creating its own carnage to feast upon. While the vines of Nemthyr does not drink blood directly, it does gain nourishment from planting its roots in blood-soaked soil.
