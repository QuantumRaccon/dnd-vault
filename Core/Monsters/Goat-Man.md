## Description
---
_This hunched, man-like figure lurches with a strange, half-hopping gait. Tattered clothing hangs from its muscled shoulders, and its legs are those of a ram, ending in cloven hooves._

**_Trespassers on the Rites_**. The first of the goat-men was the victim of a powerful curse intended to punish him for spying on magical rites exclusive to the women of his tribe. Admiring the grotesque result, the Black Goat of the Woods With a Thousand Young adopted him as its servant, and ensured that all who committed the same taboo fell to the same curse, and thus into the Black Goat's service.

**_Bleating Speech_**. A goat-man's head is human, adorned with curling ram's horns, and its black beard often drips with gore. Rows of transparent, needle-like teeth fill its mouth; these teeth are malformed and make clear speech impossible for goat-men, though they understand others' speech perfectly well.

**_Serve Foul Cults_**. Cultists of Shub-Niggurath or the Black Goat in good standing are sometimes granted the services of a goat-man. The creatures guard rituals sites, visit settlements to capture or purchase suitable sacrifices, and perform certain unspeakable acts with cult members to call forth ritual magic.
