## Description
---
_An enraged mass of malcontents storms across the tavern, overturning tables, busting bottles, and browbeating innocent patrons._

Countless stories surround the cloudy origins of the dracotaur, though most of them involve centaurs. Dragonborn believe that a dragon captured centaurs during a skirmish on the plains and drowned them in its blood centuries ago. When their bodies were fished out, they had been transformed into perfect, draconic warriors and a new, distinct species.
