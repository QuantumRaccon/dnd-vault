## Description
---
_Graceful birds with the face of a beautiful man or woman flock on the edges of dark clouds. Their plumage is the color of storms, ranging from light gray to dark slate with a green or violet hue shimmering on the eldest._

**_Singers for the Storm God_**. An alkonost's song is heard only as a precursor to a massive storm. On land, they are the harbingers of electric storms, tornadoes, and powerful winds. At sea, they fly with the seabirds ahead of hurricanes and squalls. Sailors consider their song a beautiful reckoning-a reminder that every soul has a black wave waiting to claim it.

**_Druid's Ally_**. Alkonost sometimes roost in the sacred groves of druids. There, the enigmatic creatures lay their eggs, an act normally coinciding with a tremendous electrical storm in the area. They guard both grove and eggs until the young hatch several weeks later.
