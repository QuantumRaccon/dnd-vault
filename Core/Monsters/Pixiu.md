## Description
---
_The pair of creatures, like massive lions with strangely draconic faces, gnaw contentedly on a pile of treasure. The female's spiraling horns sweep back over her skull while her mate's single horn curves up from between his eyes._

**_Devourers of Wealth_**. Pixiu feed upon gold, silver, jewels, and magic items. Offering them valuables is an easy way to gain their attention or to pass unmolested when they are guardians of a pass, spring, or shrine. Their love of bells, baubles, and (especially) gold and silver necklaces leads them to work with bandits and wizards, so long as they are well-fed. In particular, they enjoy looting shrines and temples of bronze or silver bells.

**_Ambitious and Docile_**. Female pixiu are often more ambitious and cunning than the males. In some cases, male pixiu are seen as more docile or mistaken for unusual lions or chimeras; a female pixiu always stands out in both her boldness and her aggression.

**_Trained Hunters_**. Wealthy merchants and nobles have been known to raise and train pixiu as loyal companions. A wellâ€‘trained pixiu is able to hunt for treasure and return the wealth to its master without eating it.
