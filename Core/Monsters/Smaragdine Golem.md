## Description
---
_This large statue of emerald-green crystal has a humanoid body with the head of an ibis. Tiny symbols and runes are etched into it, and portions are inlaid with bits of gold._

**_Occult Initiates_**. Smaragdine golems are crafted by disciples of occult esoterica to guard their secret meeting halls, sacred texts, and the arcane books of power.

**_Emerald Body_**. Though they seem to be made entirely of emeralds (and some are used in their construction), a smaragdine golem's body is closer to enchanted glass than to gemstones, a sad truth that has disappointed many plunderers.

**_A Maker's Privilege_**. Though smaragdine golems are sometimes given to powerful mages, scholars, theurgists, and hierophants as a token of esteem, they are always subject first to the magic and orders of their creators.

> [!INFO] Smaragdine Golems in Midgard
>Smaragdine golems are creations of the Emerald Order. Because they are grown from fragments of the Emerald Tablet, the golems embody the wisdom and knowledge of Thoth-Hermes. This makes them strangely susceptible to spells that normally have no effect on the mindless.
>Their link to the Tablet also means that these golems can track them unerringly, so long as both the tablets and the golems are on the same plane. When tracking this way, the golems act with uncanny intelligence. Rather than blindly blundering through obstacles, they seek a doorway or another path, taking an indirect path if necessary, but always moving closer to the tablets.
