## Description
---
_Relishing the darkness feared by others, the shadowmancer's undeath grants it nothing but time to study its art._

**_Servants of Alquam_**. While most darakhul follow the Hunger God, many shadowmancers praise the Demon Lord of Night, [[Alquam, Demon Lord of Night \|Alquam]] (Tome of Beasts).


**_Never Alone_**. A darakhul shadowmancer is almost never encountered alone; it is regularly accompanied by shadow guardians, [[Shadow Skeleton \|shadow skeletons]], or other horrors.


**_Frequent Spies_**. Often called upon by their emperor to serve as spies among the cities of the surface world or as emissaries to the shadow fey, darakhul shadowmancers may be encountered virtually anywhere.


**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The darakhul doesn't require air or sleep.
