## Description
---
_A living wick is a small, rough wax sculpture of a human that stands at attention, a halo of light flickering around its head from some source behind it._

**_Enchanted Wicks_**. Living wicks are obedient wax statues brought to life by an enchanted wick that runs from the nape of their neck to their lower back. When new, a living wick looks and moves like a human, but as the wick burns, the wax features melt and the statue takes on a twisted, hunchbacked appearance.

**_Short-Lived as a Candle_**. Living wicks are powered by flames, and therefore they have a predetermined life cycle. They are typically reduced to formless lumps in a month, but some say a living wick's affordability more than makes up for its inevitable obsolescence. Individuals looking to quickly construct a building or fortification without the expense of paid labor or the questionable ethics of necromancy find living wicks obedient and efficient, as do those needing an army for a single battle.
Living wicks are active only when their wicks are lit, and only respond to the telepathic commands of whoever lit them. This makes it easy to transfer living wicks between owners, even those not well-versed in the use of magic.

**_Explosive Ends_**. The amount of magical energy contained within a living wick, paired with the manner in which it is released, gives them a remarkable capability for selfdestruction. If their controller demands it, all living wicks can release the magic contained within their form all at once, engulfing themselves and anyone nearby in flames. This can make storing them a gamble, but many see it as an asset, especially those seeking to destroy evidence or anonymously attack their enemies.
