## Description
---
>A towering winged devil looms above, a wicked scimitar in its grasp. Its form shifts subtly, hinting at a deeper secret.

**_Infernal Insects_**. Infernal swarms are found throughout the Hells. Considered a delicacy, these insects can form a hive mind, which they use to shape their swarm into a massive winged devil whenever they are threatened. The individual insects are bat-winged and have bulging eyes, long spindly legs, and a carapace covered in poisonous barbs.

**_Hellish Poison_**. Infernal swarms feed on carrion, injecting the carcasses with a poison that liquifies tissue. This same poison coats their barbs, which painfully dissuades predators.

**_Sensitive to Sound_**. Loud noises disorient the insects and interrupt their coordination, temporarily scattering the individuals. However, it is rare to encounter these silent killers hunting on their own, and if one is spotted, there are certain to be many more to follow.
