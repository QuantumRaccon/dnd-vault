## Description
---
_The dragon-headed leaves of these oak trees sometimes rustle despite the lack of wind, betraying a hint of their draconic power._

**_Gifts among Dragons_**. These magnificent trees are imbued with some characteristics of their draconic masters. While most groves consist of only one type of dragonleaf tree, dragons sometimes make gifts of them to cement a pact or as a show of fealty. The dragon giving the tree relinquishes command of the plant as part of the deal. This accounts for mixed groves belonging to especially powerful dragon lords.

**_Silent Guardians_**. Dragonleaf trees use fairly simple tactics to deter potential intruders. They remain motionless or allow the breeze to jostle their leaves to appear inconspicuous. Once enough targets enter the grove, the trees fire razor sharp leaves at or breathe on their targets, adjusting their position to make better use of their weapons.

**_Long Memories_**. Dragonleaf trees live up to 1,000 years. They stand 15 feet tall and weigh 3,000 lb, but ancient specimens can reach heights of 45 feet. Growing a new dragonleaf tree requires a cutting from an existing tree at least 50 years old, which the tree's master imbues with power, sacrificing the use of its breath weapon for a month. While this time barely registers on a dragon's whole lifespan, it still carefully considers the creation of a new tree, for fear that others might discover its temporary weakness.

>The finest druidic minds in the Mharoti Empire created these trees for the draconic lords of the land. Once the druids had shown the dragons the secret of the tree's creation they were slain, so that the secret would not spread. A handful of human and kobold gardeners know how to tend them and make them thrive, but little more.
