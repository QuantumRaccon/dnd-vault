## Description
---
_These tomb guardians walk their rounds silently, an ornate sword in its hand. Glittering scarabs scurry from under their deformed and yellowed linen wrappings._

**_Willing Sacrifices_**. The undying servants of the god-kings and queens of ancient times, the imy-ut ushabti guard the tombs of their masters and shepherd them toward their eventual awakening. Generals, trusted advisors, and close allies of their god-king willingly accompanied their dying lords into the afterlife through a horrifying transformation. Still alive, they are tightly bound in linens and sealed within a sarcophagus among a swarm of flesh.eating scarabs that, over a period of days to weeks, fully consumed their bodies. The servant's devotion to their task and the anguish of their passing transforms the scarab colony and animates the funerary wrappings to carry on the imy-ut's duty.

**_Scarab Mummies_**. From a distance, the imy-ut ushabti are indistinguishable from the mummified form of their master, betrayed only by the reserved ornamentation of their lacquered armor and the ripples of movement beneath their wrappings from the mass of scarabs beneath it.

**_Warding Triads_**. Traditionally, imy.ut ushabti appear only in triads.the warden, charged with ensuring the death sleep of their godqueen is uninterrupted; the steward, tasked with escorting their master back from the land of the dead; and the herald, proclaiming their lords' return to the world of the living.
