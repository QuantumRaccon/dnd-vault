## Description
---
_This brown-skinned, black-haired woman of regal bearing has her hair up and wears a gold tiara. She is wrapped in a cloak of snake scales, bearing a design like the spectacle markings on a king cobra._

**_Reclusive Seer_**. Shahmaran the Wise, as she is known in the lands near her home, is an oracle of minor fame. She delivers advice on matters material and mystical and has the favor of the benevolent desert gods. She seldom leaves the ancient stone chambers carved into her mountain home, but those seeking her counsel arrive with enough frequency to keep her informed of the outside world. They call her "the Serpent-Kissed;" her abode is awash with serpents, yet no one comes to harm there unless they seek to do harm to Shahmaran.

**_Queen of Serpents_**. Known only to a few, Shahmaran is also an animal lord, the Queen of Serpents, who bears the mantle of protector of such creatures and treats with the gods on their behalf. The association of evil with serpents makes this a difficult task, and she secretly spends much of her time away from her home on errands and missions to keep her charges from dangers that threaten their existence and reputation. She is the only Queen of Serpents, and when she is killed a new queen rises within days.

**_Civic Mediator_**. The Queen of Serpents sees a connection between the well-being of her charges and that of humanoids in general. She's noted that humans in particular only begin worshipping serpents in undesirable ways or killing them in droves when the humans' own fortunes begin to flag. Therefore, Shahmaran, on occasion, intercedes to restore order where there is chaos among humans, though she does so while attempting to conceal her involvement.


**_The Queen of Serpents' Lair_**. The Queen of Serpents resides in an ancient stone labyrinth deep in a mountain between a rainforest and a desert. In the winter months and during the rainy season, she can be found in her lair surrounded by tens of thousands of hibernating snakes. During this time, she relies heavily on information from her non-serpentine sources. When the weather changes, she often exits her lair to interact with the humanoid settlements nearby.
**_Animal Lords_**. While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in celestial councils. The [[Queen of Serpents]] speaks to the gods of the desert, and the [[Queen of Birds]] holds a wide swath of territory with eyes drifting gently on updrafts throughout the world. Each animal lord sees and communicates with the members of its species in some mysterious and unknowable fashion. News from the granaries and the kitchens always finds its way to the [[Mouse King \|Mouse King's]] ears, and news from fields of battle or of wheat inevitably lands in the remote nest of the [[Lord of Vultures]].
What do the animal lords do with their legions and their vast array of information? Some sages believe they trade this to other figures, demon and angel alike, in exchange for favors understood best as celestial currency. Others say that they merely inform their followers of dangers to avoid, rich prey to hunt, or similar concerns. In many cases, the animal lords find they have both the time and inclination to meddle occasionally in the affairs of humanoids, especially those who are particularly kind or unusually cruel to their followers.
As a group, the animal lords look after their own, and they defend their territory and their wellsprings of power against humanoid encroachment. The great argument among the animal lords themselves is whether to align themselves with the humanoid world (as the [[Queen of Cats]] and, to some degree, the [[Mouse King]] have done) or to remain outside of it (as the others have).
