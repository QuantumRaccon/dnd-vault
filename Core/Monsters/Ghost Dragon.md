## Description
---
_In the empty dragon's lair with no trace of treasure or beast, a cold breeze from nowhere wafts through the chamber. A wavering draconic form fades into sight, its hissing anger leaking out through translucent teeth._

**_The Wrath of Dragons_**. ghost dragon's creation does not differ greatly from the creation of a human ghost. Dragons of any size, color, or magical ability can become ghost dragons. If the circumstances of the dragon's demise are troubling or violent enough, the soul may be denied an afterlife, leaving the ghost dragon's spirit to haunt the Material Plane until it finds peace. Dragons whose wrathful natures are more intense than others are most likely to become ghost dragons.


**_Tied to Lairs_**. Most ghost dragons are bound to the areas where they once laired. They may be able to roam within a mile or two of those places, but their unfinished business generally involves a notable event in their lairs: death at the hands of sneaky adventurers, betrayal by their followers, machinations of a rival dragon, etc. The ghost dragon may call upon the powers of its lair for a short time after its mortal death, but soon its lair powers (and its actions) fade. This tends to enrage the ghost dragon even more.


**_Undead Nature_**. The ghost dragon doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
