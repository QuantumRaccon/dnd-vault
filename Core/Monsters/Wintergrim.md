## Description
---
>This squat creature is covered in furs, making it almost as wide as it is tall. A large nose pokes through the furs, and its gentle eyes shine.

**_Spirit of Hospitality_**. Wintergrims are solitary fey who build their homes in remote locations. When they are alone, they spend much of their time traversing the territory surrounding their homes, watchful for creatures in dire straits or in need of shelter. Wintergrims offer assistance and lodging to travelers they encounter and jump to the rescue for those in immediate peril. They readily share the furs in which they bundle themselves and are often laden with warm soups and beverages they share with visitors suffering from the elements.

**_Inscrutable Rules_**. A wintergrim's hospitality has limits, as each wintergrim has a unique set of behaviors it holds taboo within the confines of its home. Breaking its rules is so abhorrent to a wintergrim, it dares not even discuss the things it forbids. The rules range from the seemingly innocuous—such as leaving one's boots on when entering a wintergrim's home—to common societal norms—such as not attacking or killing another guest. Discovering a wintergrim's proscribed behavior is difficult, since the wintergrim ignores transgressions outside its home, perhaps giving a cryptic warning that it wouldn't tolerate the same in its domicile. Mere discussion about its rules may also provoke the fey.
Whatever the case, wintergrims demand rulebreakers leave their premises at once, resorting to pummeling those who fail to comply.

**_Competent Woodsfolk_**. As loners with occasional guests, wintergrims are necessarily self-sustaining. They are omnivorous, and they grow gardens, set traps, and hunt for their food. Though they are inured to cold temperatures, they enjoy having a house in which they can reside and share their hospitality. They are adept with the axes they wield to chop down trees for their homes and fires, but they are careful not to overharvest wood. Other than when they hunt, they rarely use their axes as weapons. They prefer to punch their opponents in the hope they can drive their foes away, resorting to their axes only in desperate situations.
