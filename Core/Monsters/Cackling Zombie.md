## Description
---
These creatures look aesthetically similar to any other zombie, save for a subtle dark brown vapor which escapes from their mouth and nostrils. This strange gas is the result of dark magic users experimenting with mixing raise dead spells with materials infected with disease. As a result, these zombies are a disease unto themselves. Their incessant cackling sends an eerie shiver down the spine of most who hear it as they slowly shuffle and stammer their way through the dungeon, easily infecting those they encounter. If not caught and dealt with quickly, the cackling fever can quickly infect an entire small village.

**_Unknown Infection_**. Due to the nature of cackling fever, adventurers who are infected may not be aware for many hours after infection, allowing them to return to their favorite inn or tavern and spread the disease through a village or city. The disease can quickly escalate and result in a full blown outbreak. If the area is a trade hub, it can easily be spread to nearby areas, causing a region wide epidemic.
