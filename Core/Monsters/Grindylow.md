## Description
---
_This creature has a fishlike head that is almost triangular in shape, sloping down and outward toward its wide mouth, filled with small, sharp teeth. Large eyes stare unblinking from its hideous face. A scrawny chest, covered in fish scales, supports two long, wiry arms which end in three clawed digits. Its lower body resembles the long tail of an eel._

**_Menace of the Shallows_**. Grindylows live in small bands of a dozen or so individuals, primarily in warm, coastal waters. Often hunted down by merfolk, they are quick to ingratiate themselves with other intelligent predators like the sahaugin in the hopes of gaining some protection. In this way, they often find themselves absorbed into the cults of their allies, dedicated to demon lords and malevolent sea gods.


**_A Taste for Fear_**. Grindylows don't care much about religious pursuits, however. Their single passion in life consists of lurking in tide pools, rivers, and lagoons, where they wait for gnomes, halflings, or human children to come near the water's edge so they can leap up with their long, wiry arms and drag their victims under the water. They eat what they kill in this manner, but this is a matter of convenience. Their true enjoyment is derived from the attack and the fearful reactions of their prey, not the resulting meal.


**_Murderous Mimics_**. Grindylows have some talent at voice mimicry which they sometimes use to lure creatures closer to the shore, but the most use this talent sees is in the recounting of the screams of their latest or greatest successes.
