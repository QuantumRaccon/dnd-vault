## Description
---
>This massive cetacean swims through the Void while crackling lines of energy race between the crystal formations on its body and massive, feather-like flippers.

**_Born in the Void_**. Stellar rorqual are born, live, and die in the depths of the space between the stars. Generally peaceful creatures, they live to impossibly old age, singing their ancient songs to each other across immense distances.

**_Living Starships_**. Those lucky or skilled enough can use a stellar rorqual as a living ship to provide passage between planes. This partnership can be based on friendship or domination, depending on the method of training.
Communication with the rorqual is mostly telepathic, and the crystalline growths on the inside of its jaws display what the rorqual sees. Though a stellar rorqual finds it uncomfortable, it can enter the Material Plane from the Void to load or disembark passengers. When this occurs, the rorqual lands in an available ocean, if possible.

**_Void Traveler_**. The stellar rorqual doesn't require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure.
