## Description
---
_The small, skeletal dragon jumps down from the bookshelf where it was reading. It spreads its bony wings laced with brittle, leathery skin and exhales a cloud of choking dust that smells like an ancient tomb._

**_Stewed in Necromancy_**. These unholy dragon whelps were never given the chance to hatch-their mothers were slain, and the eggs which contained them carried off to dark ends. The unhatched dragon egg is stewed in a vile necromantic soup which dissolves the hard shell and melts the creature's flesh from its bones. It arises from the wretched fluid as an evil, skeletal, draconic whelp, its hollow eye sockets glowing a pale yellow.

**_More than Dead_**. In addition to the usual undead characteristics, the unhatched emerge with some minor necromantic magic. If allowed to mature, their magic grows in power, making liches especially fond of unhatched as pets.

**_Lairs of Death and Knowledge_**. They are commonly found guarding evil wizard's lairs, vampire's resting places, or crypts and tombs of various sorts. Left to their own devices, they actively seek out magical knowledge and can be encountered in ruins containing libraries or other vaults of knowledge. They are cunning opponents, using their illusion magic to draw prey into their lair. The unhatched often band together in groups of three or more.

**_Undead Nature_**. The unhatched doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
