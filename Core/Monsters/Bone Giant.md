## Description
---
Unlike its smaller skeleton cousins, the Bone Giant - the animated bones of a Hill Giant - was not originally created using dark magic. Ulrich, the dwarven cleric of Lathandar, created the giant to guard a powerful magic item against evil forces.

**_Lumbering Hulk_**. The Bone Giant is a slow, yet powerful animation. Those who battle a Bone Giant had better keep their distance or risk being pummeled by a massive bone club.
**_Grand Guardians_**. Due to their slow speed, Bone Giants are typically only used in dungeons or as guardians. They don't make for good group troops seeing as how most other creatures walk three times faster than the white hulks. However, they do make practical guards in castles and other structures where movement is limited.
