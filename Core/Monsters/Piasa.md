## Description
---
_The dragon easily stands out from its draconic cousins with a huge rack of antlers rising from its head, and a well-groomed beard jutting from its tiger-like chin and jaw line. Its incredibly long tail whips to and fro, tipped by a terrible spike._

**_Bearded Drake_**. While the beard of the piasa can be mistaken as hair, it would be more correct to say that it is made of the same chitinous material as its scales. Male piasa are covered with scales that are a shade of green, while female piasa are covered in golden scales. Male beards are often gold in color, while female beards can range from light gold to almost black.

**_Ravenous Carnivore_**. lower form of dragon, the piasa is well known for its hunger for humanoid flesh. While it will eat any source of meat, it prefers live prey that it has rendered unconscious and has a particular fondness for dwarf flesh.

**_Hunters of Snakes_**. People that live near piasa quickly learn to carry poisoned spears and arrows for protection as the beasts are particularly susceptible to it. These villages often harvest poison from local snakes, driving many piasa to ruthlessly slaughter such creatures on sight. An area clear of snakes is often a sign of a piasa's presence.
