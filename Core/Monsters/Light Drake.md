## Description
---
>The light drake is a small, bulky dragon with two legs and two wings. It has glowing yellow eyes, and light reflects easily off its golden scales.

**_Light Bringers_**. Light drakes are obsessed with bringing light into dark places, and often inhabit the darkest parts of the world. They use their light to aid lost travelers and defeat the denizens of the darkest parts of the world. They are regularly hunted by such denizens, who offer large rewards for their golden hides.

**_Social Trinket-Collectors_**. Light drakes are social creatures that live in small, glowing colonies in deep caverns. Like their larger cousins, they enjoy collecting trinkets, though they prefer objects made of bright metals or iridescent stones. They often adorn themselves with such trinkets and use their light magic to make the trinkets shine. Light drakes tend to sleep together in piles for warmth and light in the cold darkness, which has led to many a thief inadvertently stumbling into a colony of the jewelry-coated sleeping drakes after mistaking them for a pile of glittering treasure.

**_Undead Slayers_**. Light drakes despise undead and any creatures that use light, or the absence of light, to prey on innocents. They have a particularly strong hatred for [[will-o'-wisp \|will-o'-wisps]]. When a will-o'-wisp has been spotted in a light drake colony's territory, packs of the drakes tirelessly hunt for the creature until it is slain.


> [!INFO] Light Drake Familiars
>Some light drakes are willing to serve good-aligned spellcasters as a familiar. Such light drakes have the following trait.
**_Familiar_**. The light drake can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the light drake senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the light drake is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion gains the [[sacred flame]]* cantrip, using the companion's spell save DC or the light drake's, whichever is higher. At any time and for any reason, the light drake can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
*if using the _Midgard Heroes Handbook_, the companion instead gains the _starburst_ cantrip
