## Description
---
>A pool of black pitch bubbles on the ground. Skulls and bones rise to the surface with each burst of putrid air. The tar lets out a burbling hiss, as if releasing the last gasp of a creature trapped within it.

**_Necrotic Sludge_**. When a group of [[tar ghoul \|tar ghouls]] (Creature Codex) is destroyed near each other, the tar sometimes coalesces into a necrotic sludge. Driven by the hunger and hatred of the ghouls, the resulting ooze preys on the fearful.

**_Ghoulish Allies_**. Tar oozes view tar ghouls as allies and don't attack them. Tar ghouls often keep tar oozes as pets or guardians to their underground lairs. Occasionally, a tar ghoul gets the idea to build an army of tar ghouls by feeding humanoids to its pet tar oozes, but infighting quickly dismantles any organization the tar ghouls manage to create.

**_Eternal Flame_**. The tar that makes up the ooze is never consumed by fire, and it burns forever. It is prized as an alchemical component for making torches that never extinguish.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A tar ooze doesn't require sleep.
