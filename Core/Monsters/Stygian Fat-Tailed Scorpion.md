## Description
---
_The black carapace gleams in the desert sun, and its tail drips translucent venom. Even the largest lion avoids this scorpion._

**_Highly Venomous_**. Known for its small size and aggressive behavior, the Stygian fat-tailed scorpion brings a swift death to those who feel its toxic sting.

**_Pit Traps_**. A Stygian fat-tailed scorpion is no more than a foot long, with a tail about the same length. It weighs no more than 5 pounds for the largest specimensâ€”they make excellent guard animals that require little food or care, and are often kept at the bottom of pits or in rarely used tunnels.

**_Valuable Venom_**. A dose of fat-tailed scorpion venom can be worth 4,000 gp or more to the right buyer.
