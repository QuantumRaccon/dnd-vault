## Description
---
_A pasty-white spider the size of a horse slinks through the shadows. Its dull eyes fix on you as it fades from sight with a ghostly blue shimmer._

Ghostwalk spiders are malevolent hunters that sprang from misguided experiments on phase spiders. They are spindly, emaciated things all but devoid of color. The spider is 8 feet in diameter (including legs) and weighs 500 pounds.

**_Phantom Webs_**. Ghostwalk spiders spin ephemeral webs in secluded areas. They spend most of their time stalking prey to paralyze and drag back to their phantom web. As long as these remains lie tangled in ghostly webs they go unnoticed by material creatures, but the spiders eventually cast old kills aside. Adventurers are wise to fear empty caves containing unexplained, desiccated remains.
