## Description
---
>A large chameleon pokes its head below the canopy. Soon, four other identical heads peek below the treetops. A massive body accompanies the heads, revealing they all belong to one creature. The creature's odd feet and long, curled tail transport it from tree to tree with ease, and its sticky tongues allow it to slurp up prey on the forest floor as it passes.

The chameleon hydra thrives in thick, wooded areas where it makes nests in the canopies of large trees. It feasts on prey both above and below the canopy, using its sticky tongues to snatch unsuspecting prey.
**_Apex Ambush Predators_**. Chameleon hydras have scales that react to light and allow the hydras to blend in with their surroundings. They are extremely patient, waiting until the most opportune time to strike from a safe vantage point. Chameleon hydras primarily eat birds and giant insects, but they are known to dine on unwary travelers if other prey is scarce.

**_Curious and Colorful_**. Study of juvenile chameleon hydras shows they have inquisitive minds and that they alternate their scales in colorful patterns when near others of their kind. Scholars believe they use these color changes as a rudimentary form of communication.
