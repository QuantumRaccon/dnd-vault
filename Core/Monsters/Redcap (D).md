## Description
---


A madcap is a redcap that soaks its hat in demon ichor instead of blood. Contact with demon ichor makes the creature even more psychotic, causing it to brood over irrational hatreds. A group of madcaps will sometimes band together over a shared hatred of something, such as music, creatures with curly hair, the word "cool," or the color blue.

When a madcap drops to 0 hit points, its hateful existence comes to an end in spectacular fashion as it bursts into flames, reducing itself, its ichor-soaked hat, and its pants to ashes instantly while leaving behind its weapon and smoldering iron boots.
