## Description
---
A dark, droning cloud containing thousands of gray, thumb.sized wasps, shifts and swarms around the black silhouette of a tall human with glowing red eyes. The wasps, too, glow with the heat of a low-burning coal and are wreathed in foul-smelling smoke.

**_Faithless Servant_**. Ia'Affrat is the inverted reflection of his unkempt, overly-unyielding creator, Arbeyach, Hell's Prince of Swarms, and may soon be his successor. Ia'Affrat acts as Arbeyach's emissary to the courts of his rivals and to the mortal world as diplomat, spy, assassin, and scourge. Though he serves the rigid and resolute Prince of Hell, Ia'Affrat shows little loyalty to his maker. The eloquent and sophisticated creature has betrayed his master in thousands of small ways over the centuries, and eventually may betray him utterly. Until then, Ia'Affrat's shifting hive mind is pursues an unquenchable lust for arcane mysteries, human interaction, and the material pursuit of unwholesome flavors and dark delights.

**_Joker and Devourer_**. Ia'Affrat delights in comedy, wine, song, dance, food, and inflicting torture and public humiliation on his foes—he is a rapacious devourer, gluttonous and greedy for all transient pleasures. Ia'Affrat abhors all permanency and leaves nothing in his path but ruin. He laughs with glee at the shattering of keystones, the stench of burning paint, and the hollow echoes of a library reduced to rubble.


**_Arch-Devils_**. The rulers of Hell are the arch-devils, some arch-dukes and princes, others mere barons—but all with great longing to advance themselves and seize power.
