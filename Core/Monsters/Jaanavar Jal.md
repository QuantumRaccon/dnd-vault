## Description
---
_The massive white worm opens its gaping maw, revealing two square teeth, and spews flaming oil onto its prey._

Exploding out of the river, the jaanavar jal, also known as the burning beast, is the scourge of the slow-moving rivers of the East. Though dim-witted, jaanavar jal is a canny predator who consumes anything it can catch.

**_River Ambusher_**. The jaanavar jal is known to ambush herd animals, fishermen and even whole boats, spewing flaming oil from its gaping maw to roast its prey before feasting.

**_Valuable Oils_**. The glands that produce the flaming oil (naphtha) are prized among the alchemists of the East. The brave, or perhaps foolish, hunters who manage to bring down a burning beast can make their fortunes with a single kill.
