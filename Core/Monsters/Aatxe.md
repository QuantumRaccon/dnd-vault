## Description
---
_A fierce, crimson bull trots across the grass, tossing its curved horns and snorting with anger._

**_Earthbound Celestial Guardians_**. Aatxes serve as protective agents of benevolent deities, sent to watch over pious communities and provide them with a measure of protection from harm.

**_Walks Among the People_**. Though its true form is that of a great red bull, an aatxe can take on the form of a male humanoid to walk among the people it is tasked to protectâ€”the better to uncover threats to their safety. An aatxe so disguised rarely takes on the appearance of anyone familiar to those it protects and avoids unnecessary communication and attachment, attempting to pass itself off as an uninteresting traveler.


**_An Aatxe's Lair_**. Aatxes prefer to make their homes in caverns or other secluded locations, though they will forego that preference in favor of ruins or shelters which provide a view of the regions they protect.
