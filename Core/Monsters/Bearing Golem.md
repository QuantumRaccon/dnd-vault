## Description
---
>A scattering of metal ball bearings coalesces into a constantly shifting humanoid shape.

Made up of thousands of ball bearings, a bearing golem can assume nearly any shape it chooses, though it always remains an amalgamation of metal pellets.
**_Thievish Inspiration_**. The first bearing golem was created when a wizard saw a thief foiling the traps in its tower with ball bearings. After disposing of the thief, the wizard collected the metal balls and realized their purpose could be improved if the bearings spread themselves.

**_Natural Ambushers_**. Bearing golems regularly lie in wait for hours, days, even weeks, hiding as an innocuous, scattered pile of bearings. When travelers move through the bearings, the golem springs back together and attacks.

**_Construct Nature_**. The bearing golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.




Some particularly devious wizards create bearing golems out of [[caltrop \|caltrops]] instead of [[ball bearings (bag of 1,000) \|ball bearings]]. These caltrop golems deal piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage, and, when the golem uses its Scatter trait, the area is covered with [[caltrop \|caltrops]] instead of [[ball bearing (bag of 1,000) \|ball bearings]].
