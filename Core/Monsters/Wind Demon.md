## Description
---
_The marshy reek of rotting vegetation was everywhere. Even above that rank scent, though, the arrival of the demons was clear: howling, pestilent, and enough to make our horses and dogs vomit and paw their noses._

Half-corporeal and half a miasma of pestilent stench, wind demons are minor fiends that delight in foul odors, rank gasses, and poisonous air. They live in swamps, marshes, sewers and near volcanic ventsâ€”wherever a natural or synthetic stench reeks.

**_Shrieking Servants of Cold and Death_**. Cold and foul-smelling, wind demons delight in serving other demons or gods of cold and decay. They often attend dark rituals to such divine beings, howling hideous prayers at a volume that can be heard over hills and valleys. They are sometimes found around wind harp devils, a rare instance where demons and devils tolerate one another's company.


**_Rushing Motion_**. Wind demons have great difficulty sitting still for more than a moment. They are always in constant motion: speaking, manipulating small objects, blowing out torches and candles, and generally making a nuisance of themselves around larger, slower demons or among humans who wish to attend to some urgent plot or scheme.


**_Connoisseurs of Rot_**. Wind demons are utterly delighted by foul smells of all kinds; rotting corpses, decaying plant matter, and raw sewage are all equally appealing to them. They often form small globes of concentrated stench to share with their own kind or to offer as gifts to summoners and to other demons.
