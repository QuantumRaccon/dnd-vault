## Description
---


A satyr might carry panpipes that it can play to create magical effects. Usually, only one satyr in a group carries such pipes. If a satyr has pipes, it gains the following additional action option.

**_Panpipes_**. The satyr plays its pipes and chooses one of the following magical effects: a charming melody, a frightening strain, or a gentle lullaby. Any creature within 60 feet of the satyr that can hear the pipes must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be affected as described below. Other satyrs and creature that can't be [[charmed]] are unaffected
An affected creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a creature's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the creature is immune to these panpipes for the next 24 hours.
The creature is [[charmed]] by the satyr for 1 minute. If the satyr or any of its companions harms the creature, the effect on it ends immediately.
The creature is [[frightened]] for 1 minute.
The creature falls asleep and is [[unconscious]] for 1 minute. The effect ends if the creature takes damage or if someone takes an action to shake the creature awake.
