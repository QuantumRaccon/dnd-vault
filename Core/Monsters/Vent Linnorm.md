## Description
---
>The immense reptile soars through the water, long and sleek. Its powerful tail undulates rhythmically, threatening all in its terrifying wake.

**_Terrors of the Deep_**. Vent linnorms live near hydrothermal fissures located in the deepest parts of the ocean. When they are not hunting, they can be found basking in their lairs, enjoying the dark, warm waters of their homes. They are proficient hunters whose diet includes all varieties of sharks and whales, giant squid, [[dragon turtle \|dragon turtles]], [[dragon eel \|dragon eels]] (Tome of Beasts), and [[young sea dragon \|younger sea dragons]] (Tome of Beasts). While they are generally solitary creatures, mated pairs sometimes team up to hunt ancient sea dragons and kraken before resuming their solitary lives.

**_Primeval Dragons_**. Like their draconic kin, vent linnorms enjoy amassing hoards of treasure and burying it in the silty floor of their lairs. Young linnorms spend much of their time searching through the wreckage of sunken vessels, while older ones actively sink passing ships, eating the sailors and picking up the fallen treasures at their leisure.

**_Aboleth Hunters_**. Through cleverness and scheming, [[aboleth \|aboleths]] often dominate vent linnorms for use as servants and war beasts, and enjoy doing so. For their part, linnorms despise aboleths for enslaving them. A vent linnorm who becomes aware of the presence of aboleths immediately ceases its current activity and moves to destroy its hated enemy.
