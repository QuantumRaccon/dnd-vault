## Description
---
_A cloud of ash and fire draws closer, revealing itself to be dozens of tiny, soot-covered bats._

These creatures were bred as part of the schemes of cultists of [[Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire \|Camazotz]] (Tome of Beasts), in the hope of creating a massive swarm of beasts that could fly to the sun and consume it. It's unlikely this ever could have worked, even if the creatures had turned out as intended, but something went horribly wrong during the ritual. What resulted was flame eaters: highly dangerous creatures that swarm into flying clouds, consume fire, and attack any creatures they encounter. They ignite flammable material, causing more fires, which the flame eaters devour and spread to other areas.

**_Bane of the Living_**. These creatures are hated and feared by most living things. Even derros and their fellow insane cultists who created flame eaters are sometimes forced to eradicate the beasts for their own safety.


**_Fire Cloud_**. Individually, a flame eater resembles an ashcolored bat with an oversized head, distended jaws, and glowing red eyes. As a swarm, they resemble a cloud of swirling embers.
