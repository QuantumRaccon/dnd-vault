## Description
---
_This hunched and scrawny goblin has a long nose and pointed ears and wears an insincere, obsequious expression on its slategrey face. Dressed in a servant's uniform, it conceals a large knife behind its back._

**_Unseelie Servants_**. Someone needs to cook the meals, scrub the floors, and polish the silverware in the courts of the shadow fey, and more often than not these jobs fall on the shadow goblins. Smarter than the average goblin but just as cowardly and lazy, shadow goblins have served the shadow fey for centuries, working in the kitchens, stables, and smithies under the direction of a chamberlain known as the Goblin King, who presides over his own "court" below stairs. Shadow goblins make good cooks and reasonable grooms, but they are indifferent footmen and chambermaids.


**_Touched by Shadow_**. Most shadow goblins were originally average goblins but living in the Shadow Realm for so long has changed them. They have taken on some of their masters' fey qualities. Others were once shadow fey or humans, who were caught stealing from powerful members of the courts or who offended shadow fey rulers and were transformed into shadow goblins as punishment.


**_Untrustworthy Guides_**. Outsiders of low status visiting the shadow fey courts often end up relying on shadow goblins as guides and sources of information. Unfortunately, the goblins tend to be both annoyingly whiny and notorious liars. Although they are easily intimidated, shadow goblins are never truly cooperative and will disappear at the first sign of danger. Their loyalty to their shadow fey masters is born out of fear. They are reluctant to do anything that is likely to upset their masters and lead to a thrashing. Those outsiders that bully the goblins tend to suffer subsequently from badly-cooked food, missing bits of gear, and other petty acts of retribution.
