## Description
---
>This lengthy, two-headed, serpentine creature has three dorsal fins and six legs.

**_Degenerate Dragons_**. Pal-rai-yuks were once a species of underwater dragons. In their arrogance, they angered a sea deity who cursed them. To escape the deity's wrath, they adapted to tunnel through the earth, though they occasionally still seek prey in the water.

**_Forgotten Meals_**. By some quirk of the pal-rai-yuk's divine transformation, creatures it swallows can see outside of its stomachs, but the creatures aren't visible to those outside the pal-rai-yuk. Additionally, this quirk allows the serpents to erase their victims from others' memories, leaving victims with a deep sense of isolation as they are slowly digested.

**_Endlessly Hungry_**. The sea god segmented their stomachs in an attempt to curb their voraciousness. Unfortunately, it made them more gluttonous. This gluttony occasionally draws the attention of powerful humanoids or large armies. When this happens, the pal-rai-yuk quickly consumes anything it can catch, then digs deep into the earth where it hibernates for years, avoiding retaliation.
