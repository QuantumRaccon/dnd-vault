## Description
---
_The beautiful snake woven into the rug begins to shift and slide as if slithering. It grows larger and springs from the surface of the rug._

Found on tapestries and rugs, thread-bound constructs are created with magic that infuses textiles with the essence of a once-living creature. They appear mundane until triggered, at which point the pattern comes to life.

**_Thread-Bound_**. When killed, the creature vanishes, reappearing upon the textile to which it is bound in a death pose. At the next dawn, it again assumes its living pattern and can be triggered again. If the textile is destroyed while the pattern of the creature is on it, the creature is also destroyed. Otherwise, damage to the textile does not harm the creature. If the creature is killed and the textile has been destroyed, the creature is permanently destroyed

**_Construct Nature_**. The thread-bound construct doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

> [!INFO] Thread-Bound Construct Template
>Only a beast or monstrosity can be made into a thread-bound construct. To create one, a spellcaster ritually sacrifices a living creature over a textile's materials. The creator must then meditate over the newly woven textile for a week, setting the conditions that trigger the creature, like the conditions in the [[glyph of warding]] spell. When a creature becomes a thread-bound construct, it retains all its statistics except as noted below.
>**Type**. The creature's type changes to construct, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.
>**Senses**. The construct gains darkvision 60 feet. Resistances. The construct gains resistance to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing from nonmagical attacks.
>**Immunities**. The construct gains immunity to poison damage and to the charmed, exhaustion, frightened, paralyzed, petrified, and poisoned conditions.
>**Languages**. The construct understands the languages of its creator but can't speak.
>**Antimagic Susceptibility**. As the thread-bound constrictor snake.
>**Immutable Form**. As the thread-bound constrictor snake.
>**Magic Weapons**. As the thread-bound constrictor snake.
>**Shifting Form**. As the thread-bound constrictor snake.
