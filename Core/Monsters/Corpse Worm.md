## Description
---
>A large, bloated worm, its body the gray-white pallor of death and slicked with yellow mucus, crawls across a pile of corpses. As its dozens of legs propel it over the bodies, its fang-filled maw opens to reveal a second jaw that repeatedly bursts outward, slurping up chunks of flesh with each strike.

These creatures prowl deep caverns, seeking flesh to devour.
**_Eaters of the Dead_**. The corpse worm feeds primarily on death and decay, though it hunts and kills living prey it encounters if hungry. Corpse worms have a keen sense of smell that they can use to locate wounded prey or sources of carrion on which to feed.

**_Ignore the Unliving_**. While both the living and the dead are food for the corpse worm, it doesn't feed upon the undead. Unless attacked, the corpse worm ignores undead near it. Some intelligent undead tame and train corpse worms, using them as pets, guardians, or shock troops.

**_Slimy Eggs_**. Corpse worm eggs are about the size of a human head and are sheathed in a rubbery, translucent gray membrane. The eggs are deposited with a pungent, sticky, mustard-colored excretion, allowing them to be placed on walls or even ceilings.
