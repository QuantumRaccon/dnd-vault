## Description
---
_This huge snake has a pair of wide horns, like those of a bull, and a smooth, opaque, red, ovoid stone between its eyes that gives off a faint glow._

**_Plague Bearers_**. Known to be a bringer of magical plagues, horned serpents are also sought after for their horns and the strange stones between their eyes, both believed to have powerful curative properties.


**_Wilderness Wanderer_**. Horned serpents travel between lakes, ponds, and deep rivers, never staying in one area for more than a few seasons. Though they live primarily in the water, they venture onto the land to hunt, where the sweetness of their poisonous scent draws game to them.


**_Grisly Signs_**. The presence of a horned serpent is most often detected by an area of dead creatures, poisoned but otherwise untouched.
