## Description
---
_Despite its frail appearance, the rotting, fiendish creature commands considerable arcane power._

The first pact lich was a warlock whose patron was a demon lord of undeath. In a moment of whimsy, the demon granted the warlock's petition to become a powerful undead.

**_Soul Devourer_**. A pact lich must feed souls to its patron weekly to retain its lich status. It does this by reducing a creature to 0 hp within 120 feet of a diamond. Diamonds act as conduits for pact liches to send souls to their patrons, but only fist-sized or larger diamonds will do. A lich that forgets or refuses to sacrifice souls begins to physically fall apart, enduring incredible pain.

**_Rebirth by Patron's Mercy_**. When a pact lich's body is destroyed, the will and mind of the lich drains from it and returns to its patron. The patron decides whether to keep the pact lich or allow it to return to the Material Plane. Patrons are fickle beings and may decide to keep the lich for weeks or even centuries as punishment for its failure or may choose to never allow the lich to return. If the lich is allowed to return to the Material Plane, its body reforms in its lair next to a diamond it has used to send souls to its patron. Because the destruction of such diamonds means the possibility of eternal death, a pact lich usually hides many of these diamonds within its lair.

**_Undead Nature_**. A pact lich does not require air, food, drink, or sleep.

> [!INFO] A Pact of a Different Color
>The pact lich represented here is based on the Fiend patron. Not all patrons, especially not those of good or neutral alignment, would allow their warlocks to take the steps needed to become a pact lich. Those who revel in undeath, however, take special glee in unleashing such a destructive force on the world and reaping the souls the pact lich harvests. If you want to bring a pact lich into play from a different patron, some changes should be considered. Damage resistances, immunities, and actions like Hurl Through Hell can all be changed to reflect a different pact, like resistance to all weapons not made with cold iron for a pact lich whose patron is one of the Fey Lords or Ladies or hurtling a creature through the kaleidoscopic unknown of the Elemental Planes for a pact lich whose patron is a Genie Lord.
