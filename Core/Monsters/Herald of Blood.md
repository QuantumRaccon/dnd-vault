## Description
---
_The heralds of blood are 20-foot-tall giants with bruised purple skin, and wart-like blood blisters that deform their features. They often wear cowled robes over golden armor streaked with black or green, and their staves of power are always ebony and mithral, embedded with precious stones._

As powerful sorcerers and blood mages, heralds of blood are without peer. They enjoy enslaving ogres and giants whenever possible, though they make do with lesser slaves when they must.

**_Dark Prophets_**. Their stirring speeches proclaim that the end times are fast approaching, and their followers must prepare for a bloody reckoning. Behind their charismatic preaching, the heralds of blood serve elder earth gods that demand blood sacrifices, especially dark druid orders devoted to human hunts and the murder of innocents. They have the power to grant strength, lust, and vitalityâ€”or to wither those who cross them.

**_Blood Magic Vortexes_**. In their true form, which they keep hidden except in battle, heralds of blood are swirling vortexes of blood, bone, and raw magical power. They feed on ley line magic and the black blood of the earth as much as on flesh and blood.
