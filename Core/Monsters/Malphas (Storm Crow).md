## Description
---
_Keen eyed and dangerous, a malphas is a winged fey warrior, dressed in finery. Her longsword often sport an ornate pommel or a rich scabbard. Among the fey, they are often referred as storm crows, meaning bearers of bad news._

**_Sworn to the Shadow Fey_**. Raised with a sword in their hands, the malphas are fierce warriors who serve the aristocracy of the shadow fey unswervingly.

**_Messengers_**. Laconic in speech, they nevertheless serve as envoys and messengers from time to time, though as much or more is communicated by the choice in messenger as in the message itself.
