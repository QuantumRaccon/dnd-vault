## Description
---
This gaunt old man—unwashed, disheveled, clad in ragged pants and a tattered coat, with stringy gray hair and yellow skin—stands nearly eight feet tall. Beneath his shredded clothing, his flesh hangs in strips from his bones, revealing innards swarming with insects.

**_Lord of Decay_**. The Prince of Swarms is the slow creep of decay; the worm and the locust that feed on life and death alike. He is the disinterested order that stamps out all voices that dare speak against the customs of the hive. Even among the unyielding denizens of the Hells, Arbeyach is exceptionally rigid. He finds disorder painful and disobedience enraging. His lairs and his minions all follow the model of the hive, with each and every member obeying a specific function.

**_Born of Flies_**. Arbeyach was created by Beelzebub when the Lord of Lies and Flies spat forth a cloud of vermin, that they might consume for him the first mortal soul to arrive in the Hells. The cloud's essence melded with those souls and became something unique: a being of terrible power that called itself Arbeyach. The self-styled Prince of Swarms has little interest in mortals, viewing the Material Plane not as a source of souls but as a chaos to be wiped clean and set to order.

**_A Fading Power_**. As the eons passed, Arbeyach's interests and ambitions deviated further from those of the Hellish lords around him. He grows ever more unyielding, ever more alien. Eventually, those below and those above him expelled the Prince of Swarms from power; none can say whether Arbeyach allowed himself to be deposed. He was once nearly as powerful as the Arch-Dukes, but time and habit have weakened him so that now he is scarcely greater than the pit fiends. If he fails to molt and shed his carapace of familiar habits, his many foes need only wait for an opportune moment to destroy him forever.

> [!INFO] Arbeyach in Midgard
>In the Southlands, the insectoid tosculi still revere the Great Hivelord Arbeyach, and their hive-cities reflect their patron's philosophy of clear functionality and unyielding order. While Arbeyach is indifferent to their prayers and pleas, the tosculi nevertheless remain a significant source of his following and strength. From time to time, Arbeyach sends his herald to visit the tosculi hives and ensure their continued loyalty.


**_Arch-Devils_**. The rulers of Hell are the arch-devils, some arch-dukes and princes, others mere barons—but all with great longing to advance themselves and seize power.
