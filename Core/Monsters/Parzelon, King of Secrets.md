## Description
---
_This hulking fiend has a frightening leonine head atop the preternatural physique of a huge human body. A pronged crown sits upon his maned skull, and his eyes burn with a deep labradorite iridescence._

**_Saint of Vile Soothsayers_**. Parzelon is a formidable warrior as well as a patron of scholars. His ashen left hand wields an enormous immortal viper like a whip, while his right brandishes a terrible silver trumpet that heralds his coming (he loves to announce himself in lavish style). When summoned, the King of Secrets travels upon the back of a massive, fiendish black bear (treat as an adult red dragon with no fly speed, tail, wings, or legendary actions), who serves the Archâ€‘Devil for eternity as his steed and companion.


**_Lord of Fallen Houses_**. The King of Secrets is a cunning monarch among devils, who attends mortals only to further his elusive, infernal agendas. A retinue of twenty two devils obey his will, belonging to both the Order of Virtues and the Order of Thrones. Two ancient [[Orobas Devil \|orobas devils]] (Tome of Beasts) serve him as spies and advisers.
