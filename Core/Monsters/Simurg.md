## Description
---
_The titanic creature's wolf-like paws reach for the ground, as its wings whip up a cloud of dust. Its canine muzzle releases an ear-splitting howl, while an incredibly long tail of multi-hued feathers drifts lazily on the wind._

**_Benevolent Guardians_**. Simurg are kind-hearted and protect those who dwell near them. When nesting atop a temple or sacred mountain, a simurgh often comforts and helps the local poor by healing their diseases and injuries and salving the passing of those it cannot help. After a time, the simurg flies away when too many pilgrims crowd its mountain or threaten to overwhelm a small country shrine.

**_Cycle of Life_**. When it dies, a simurg is consumed by a heatless flame and is reborn elsewhere on the same plane in a burst of light. This leads to it often being mistaken for a phoenix.

**_Enmity Towards Snakes_**. Simurg have a loathing of snakes and serpents and will attack them on sight. Even the lowliest of snakes understands this and will either hide from a simurg or be immediately hostile toward the simurg.
