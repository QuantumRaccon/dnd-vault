## Description
---
_Covered in writhing tattoos, the giant whispers strange words to itself._

**_Servants of the Void_**. The great void dragons maintain their primary lairs in the Void, the place of nothingness; however, some also keep lairs in the material world. These lairs are often empty of dragons, but still contain the great wealth that void dragons collect. Void giants, powerful servants of the void dragons, keep their masters' treasures safe.


**_Seekers of Power_**. Void giants roam the world, looking for suitable lairs for their dragon masters. In the course of their duties, they get many opportunities to seek knowledge and practice the void magic to which the dragon masters give them access and training.


**_Physical Representations of the Void_**. Stolen as children from cloud giant clans, void giants are imbued with dark magic from a young age. They are covered with writhing tattoos, arcane writings of the Void made manifest on their flesh, in dark rituals performed by their void dragon masters throughout their upbringing. These writings are the source of the giants' great spellcasting ability.
