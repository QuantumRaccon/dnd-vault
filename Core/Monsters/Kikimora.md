## Description
---
_This strange-looking humanoid combines the features of an old crone and some manner of bird. A shawl covers her head but cannot contain her prominent beak and clawed hands. Her skirt reveals bird-like feet._

**_Filthy Illusions_**. Kikimoras are devious house spirits who torment those they live with unless they are catered to and cajoled. They delight in harassing homeowners with their illusions, making a house look much filthier than it actually is. Their favored illusions include mold, filth, and scuttling vermin.
They love secretly breaking things or making such destruction seem like an accident. They then convince the house's residents to leave gifts as enticement for making repairs in the night.

**_Brownie Hunters_**. Kikimoras hate brownies. While brownies can be mischievous, kikimoras bring pain and frustration on their housemates instead of remaining hidden and helping chores along. Some brownies seek out kikimora-infested homes with the intention of evicting them.
If homeowners refuse to appease the kikimora (or cannot rid themselves of her devious presence), the kikimora sends a swarm of spiders, rats, or bats. Many times inhabitants in a home plagued by a kikimora believe it is haunted.

**_Fast Talkers_**. While they try to avoid notice and aren't great talespinners, kikimoras are convincing and use this influence to gain an upper handâ€”or to evade capture or avoid violence.
