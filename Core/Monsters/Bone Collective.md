## Description
---
_A bone collective is almost a fluid; its thousands of tiny bones coalesce into a humanoid form only to disperse in a clattering swarm the next moment. Their tiny bones rustle when they move, a quiet sound similar to sand sliding down a dune._

**_Spies and Sneaks_**. Bone collectives are not primarily fighters, although they swarm well enough. They prefer to spy and skulk. When cornered, however, they fight without fear or hesitation, seeking to strip the flesh from their foes.

**_Zombie Mounts_**. Bone collectives' long finger bones and hooked claws help them climb onto zombie mounts and control them. Bone collectives almost always wear robes or cloaks, the better to pretend to be humanoid. They understand that most creatures find their nature disturbing.

**_Feed on Society_**. Bone collectives join the societies around them, whether human, goblin, or ghoul. They prey on the living and the dead, using them to replenish lost bones. Occasionally, they choose to serve necromancers, darakhul, some vampires, and liches, all of whom offers magical attunements and vile joys to the collective.
They dislike extreme heat, as it makes their bones brittle.
