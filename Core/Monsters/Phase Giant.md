## Description
---
>This immense humanoid is covered in dark, spiny, chitinous skin, and its sizeable fists are rough and decorated with sharp spikes.

**_Natural Carapace_**. The phase giant has naturally hard skin, similar to that of a giant insect. Its face, hands, and joints are articulated and overlapping, allowing it to move freely beneath its hardened skin. The carapace grows into spikes in numerous places throughout its body, which it uses against captured prey and to aid it in climbing.

**_Highly Mobile_**. Deep caverns can be difficult to navigate with their twists and tight squeezes. The phase giant overcomes this by sliding into the Ethereal Plane and passing through the solid stone.

**_Familial_**. Phase giants are smaller than the average hill giant, but they more than make up for it in their ferocity. They are aggressive toward others, but not actually evil, tending to view most they encounter as mere annoyances. They are usually found in small family units of up to four, but rarely band together in larger groups.
