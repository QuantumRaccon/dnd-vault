## Description
---
_At first the creature looks like an emaciated man running, then it looks like a large wolf. Right before it attacks, it is obvious the creature is neither._

**_Born of Greed and Starvation_**. The wendigo's origins are mysterious. Some claim they are beings summoned forth from the corpses of humans who have died of starvation. Others say they come from those who have died because of cannibalism or their own greed.

**_An Insatiable Appetite_**. Wendigos are found in harsh climates, preying on the weak and hungry. Legends speak of entire settlements devoured by a single wendigo. All that remains of these settlements are eerily silent buildings and a few scattered bones, all material wealth untouched.

**_An Emaciated Horror_**. Wendigos have an emaciated humanoid shape with some disturbing lupine features, described by one scholar as a "hairless zombie werewolf.

**_Punisher of Vices_**.  Wendigos also have a special role in the punishment for cannibalism and greed. Greedy or cannibalistic individuals whose vices have caused the deaths of others, directly or indirectly, might be cursed by those victims as the victims die. This curse manifests as a wendigo being unleashed into the world.
