## Description
---
_Ravenalas guard tropical forests and watch after local flora and fauna. Their heads are crowned by long-stemmed, green-paddled fronds and spiked seed pods, and their dangling arms end in hooked wooden talons._

**_Leafy Advisors_**. Tribal humanoids respect and venerate ravenelas, and sometimes seek their advice or magical aid at times of great need. Ravenalas seldom interact with other species unless approached and questioned.

**_Prisoners Lamentation_**. Unlike treants, ravenalas avoid physical conflict in favor of magical responses. If annoyed, they imprison hostile creatures within their trunks rather than killing or eating them. Trapped creatures must sing their own lament as they are carried off to a distant, dangerous locale.
Ravenalas grow to about 20 feet tall and can weigh 1,800 lb.
