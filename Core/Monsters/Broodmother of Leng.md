## Description
---
>A bloated purple spider the size of a castle gate, covered in gold, jewels, and its chittering young, lumbers forward.

Deep in the bowels of the cursed land of Leng, the [[spider of leng \|spiders of Leng]] (Tome of Beasts) vie for the gaze of the rare broodmothers.
**_War Upon the World_**. All spiders that reside in Leng hate humanoids with seething passion. Each broodmother looks upon her brood not as children, but as a personal army that shall one day wipe all humanoids from the face of the Material Plane.

**_Champion Suitors_**. Spiders of Leng often bring treasures or captives back to the broodmother's cavern to prove their worth as a mate and help grow the broodmother's army. If a spider's campaign is deemed worthy, the spider is eaten, its life force and magical talents passing on to the next generation germinating within the broodmother. If a spider is unworthy, it is killed and dropped into the depths of the broodmother's caverns.

**_Dangerous, Sparkling Caverns_**. The caverns of the broodmothers hold generations of treasures brought by their many suitors. Though broodmothers love their hoards, their love for themselves and their brood outweighs their ancient greed. Broodmothers often have a great many spiders of Leng protecting their caverns, usually offspring still too young to join the broodmother's armies or suitors serving as guardians until the broodmother is ready to hatch another brood.
