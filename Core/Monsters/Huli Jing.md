## Description
---
>A woman of unearthly beauty smiles behind her ornamental fan before suddenly transforming into a brilliantly white fox with nine tails.

**_Canine Animosity_**. Dogs are not fooled by the huli jing's deceptions. No matter how a huli jing tries to hide its true nature, it can't hide its fox scent from dogs.

**_Energy Feeders_**. The huli jing possess great powers as long as they absorb sufficient energy, most often derived from moonlight or sunshine. This is but a trickle, however, compared to the life-force of mortals. Huli jing use their shapechanging to live among humans, secretly feeding off the populace or from willing allies, exchanging life energy for the fey's aid.

**_Symbols of Luck or Curses_**. The huli jing are neither good nor evil but act according to their individual natures. Some walk among the mortal races, their aid and kindness spreading tales of the huli jing's auspicious benevolence. Others seek to confuse, trick, or harm mortals, and their malicious cruelty gives rise to stories of the huli jing as malevolent omens.
