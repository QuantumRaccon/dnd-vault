## Description
---
>Row after row of bruise-purple fungus grows from the rocks like living shelves. The air becomes hazy as the fungus lets out a sudden puff of spores.

**_Ambitious Parasite_**. The ophio fungus is native to the subterranean caverns that wind through Leng, but it has no intention of remaining solely in its native world. The fungus seeks to infect as many carriers as possible to distribute itself across many planes and worlds.

**_Mind Control_**. The fungus attempts to infect carriers by issuing clouds of microscopic spores. Once inhaled, these spores attack the victim's brain, sapping their willpower and eventually leaving the victim under the control of the fungus.

**_Master Plan_**. Once a victim is infected with ophio spores, it is entirely under the control of the fungus, connected to the parent fungus by a psychic link that even reaches across planes. The fungus uses these victims to carry pieces of itself to other places or to lure more victims into its caverns.


> [!INFO] Ophio Spores
>This disease affects humanoids who breathe. The eyes of infected creatures become glassy, and purple bruising appears on their spines, bulging as the disease progresses. At the end of each long rest after infection, an infected creature is wracked by terrible dreams or visions and must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of [[exhaustion]] that can't be removed until the disease is cured. After the creature has two levels of [[exhaustion]], it moves to the second stage of the infection. During the first stage of infection, a [[lesser restoration]] spell or similar magic ends the infection.
>At the end of each long rest after the creature reaches the second stage of infection, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become a thrall of the ophio fungus, falling completely under its control. A victim in the second stage of the infection or that is completely under the fungus' control can be restored only by killing the fungus that caused the infection or through the use of a [[wish]] spell.
