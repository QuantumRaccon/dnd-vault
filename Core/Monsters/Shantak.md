## Description
---
_A loathsome, horse-headed creature of elephantine bulk stretches its great slippery wings in malignant joy. The leering monstrosity calls out with tittering tones that rasp like the scratching of ground glass._

**_Nameless Sentinels_**. The noisome and hippocephalic birds known as shantaks are the stuff of grotesque legends. These incredible, winged colossi originate from the fabled Mountains of Leng, where they brood amongst immense quarries and cyclopean cities of onyx.

**_Hideous Mounts_**. Shantaks often serve as mounts and servitors of arcane summoners and travelers of the Void (such as the inter-planar Folk of Leng). The rime and niter of the nether pits cling to the enormous wings of these repugnant beasts.

**_Void Traveler_**. The shantak doesn't require air, food, drink, or ambient pressure.
