## Description
---
**_Soulless Fey_**. Almost always female, these water fey lack a soul and may only gain one through bonding with a mortal. Undines often use their charm and talent for illusion to draw mortals to them, wooing the mortal into a binding kiss in an attempt to gain an immortal soul.
**_Water Bonds_**. In many cases, undines befriend or partner with water elementals. The two communicate and share a single spirit, acting almost like a single creature. Some believe the undine devours or controls the elemental; others say the elemental worships and adores the undine willingly.
