## Description
---
_One of the rocks suddenly lurches, and rises out of the water. A great eye glides open in the side of what seemed to be a boulder, and a massive, beaklike mouth gapes in the surf._

**_Island Reefs_**. The zaratan is an impossibly huge sea turtle so large that entire ecosystems develop and grow on its stony, mountainous shell. Drifting on warm ocean currents or settled on shoals, they are often mistaken for small tropical islands. The creature's head is at least 100 feet in diameter, with a ridge in the center like a tall hill. Its head resembles a massive boulder, and its 200-foot long flippers are mistaken for reefs.

**_Ageless Slumber_**. Zaratans spend their millennia-long lives in slumber. They drift on the surface of the ocean, their mouths slightly open, and reflexively swallow larger creatures that explore the "cave." They spend centuries at a time asleep. A zaratan may know secrets long lost to the world, if only it can be awakened and bargained with.

**_Deep Divers_**. Waking a zaratan is a dangerous proposition, as their usual response to any injury severe enough to waken them is to dive to the crushing black depths. Some zaratan commune with oceanic races in this time, such as deep ones, sahuagin, or aboleth.
