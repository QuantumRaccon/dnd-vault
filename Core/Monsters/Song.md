## Description
---
_A golden-skinned woman sings a sublime melody that cascades over the charging soldiers. As she sings, music notes etch themselves onto her skin._

**_Kind, yet Discerning_**. Song angels are archetypal altruists, delivering unprovoked acts of kindness upon people in need. When a song angel interacts with mortal nobility, it prefers to take an unassuming form such as a dirty urchin or crone to test its charges' integrity. If spurned by a callous or haughty individual, the song angel unveils its true, radiant splendor.
**_Keepers of Music_**. When a song angel plays or sings a verse, the notes it performed appear on its body. If the angel is destroyed, all the music it ever created rings out in glorious harmony; its heavenly elegy audible for miles.
**_Lead through Inspiration_**. While a song angel's mission is to comfort and safeguard its mortal charges, it is meant to lead, not to serve. These angels often command soldiers on the front line, inspiring all those who hear its songs.
**_Immortal Nature_**. The song angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
