## Description
---
_With bright, striped pants and rapiers at the ready, it would seem to be impossible to miss the sight of these short, brawling fey. And yet one continually overlooks them, their voices echoing too high to hear._

The quicksteps move through life at a hurtling pace, never pausing for more than a moment, speaking quickly and impatiently, always ready to move on while slower, duller creatures surround them with sluggish frustrations.

**_Fey Fashions_**. The quicksteps have a fondness for bright, patterned clothing with outrageous puffed sleeves, striped hose, and the like. Bright gems and sharp tailoring always get their attention, at least for a moment.

**_Cannot Resist a Challenge_**. Moving swiftly and largely invisibly, quicksteps are excellent messengers, scouts, and spiesâ€”but they have a love of dueling and challenges. It is extremely rare for them to turn down an invitation to single combat. They slow down their motions on these occasions, to allow their opponents to see defeat coming.

**_Friends to Gold and Silver_**. The quicksteps are happy to visit any fey court, light or dark, and can be quite mercenary in their demeanor. They claim they require rich pay to cover the expenses of their fine clothes and the maintenance of their moonlight-enhanced weapons.
