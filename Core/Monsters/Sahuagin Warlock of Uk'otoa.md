## Description
---


Sahuagin warlocks of Uk'otoa who have exceptional potential in the eyes of the leviathan lord are granted a [[rod of retribution]] in addition to Uk'otoa's typical blessing, the Sword of Fathoms. A sahuagin warlock of Uk'otoa holding this rod gains the following reaction:

**_Retribution (3/Day)_**. When a creature the warlock can see within 60 feet of it damages the warlock, the creature must make a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw, taking 11 (**2d10**) lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
