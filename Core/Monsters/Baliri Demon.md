## Description
---
>A muscular humanoid with gray-black skin and the oversized head of a donkey lumbers forward. The monster's eyes and tongue loll from its head, and its arms end in crimson crab-like pincers that snap together with incredible strength.

**_Tormented Killers_**. A baliri demon is created when a humanoid suffers at the hands of family or peers and turns to one of the demon lords for succor and bloody retribution. The result is both catastrophic and deadly, and the victim of the abuse is often executed for their dark dealings. It is at this moment that the demon lord snatches up the victim's soul and transforms it into a baliri demon, a savage and remorseless killer that seeks to spread misery in its wake.

**_Braying Apostles_**. A baliri demon is a devout servant of the demon lord that created it, stridently extolling the virtues of its demonic master even as it butchers and defiles anyone who stands in its way. The loud braying prayers and hymns of a baliri demon carry for miles across the blasted Abyssal landscape and fill the hearts of mortals and lesser demons alike with dread. Baliri demons are not picky when it comes to choosing their victims but have a preference for anyone who resembles an aggressor from their previous life.
