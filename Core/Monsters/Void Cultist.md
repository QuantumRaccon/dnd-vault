## Description
---
Cultists are the most numerous void-touched; simple men and women taken and changed by the corrupt touch of the Void. Quite mad, they throw themselves into their filthy rituals and to certain death against their enemies with equal abandon. Void cultists show the corrupt nature of the Void in their bodies. Twisted and warped, they use these deformities as weapons against the enemies of the cult. While the cultists speak [[Void Speech]], they lack the control to cause more than superficial pain and destruction with its vile syllables.
