## Description
---
It is theorized that callers from the deep are natural occurrences in the Plane of Water, where cast-offs of all manner are common. Where magic and death come to rest in the Darkened Depths, malevolence grows, and sometimes that malevolence grows impatient for its next meal. The caller from the deep appears as a monstrous mass of writhing black tentacles, reaching and grasping for its next meal. It has no mouth or eyes but senses living things in the water around it.

**_Patient Lurker_**. A caller from the deep lurks in the shadows and crevasses of the deepest sections of the Plane of Water, but it is not uncommon for one to form in the Sea of Light, especially in a particularly devastating sea wreck. It feeds on ambient life energy and can go for long stretches without feeding.
**_Necromantic Hunger_**. It has been theorized by some hydromancers that a caller from the deep only appears when a planar crack appears between the Plane of Water and the Plane of Shadow. That would explain the creature's life draining capabilities and hunger for living creatures, though no definitive research has been done to date. All attempts have ultimately resulted in the demise of all researchers.
