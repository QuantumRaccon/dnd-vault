## Description

>A humanoid-shaped block of ice lumbers forward on angular legs.

**_Visitors from Polar Portals_**. Remote polar regions possess their own entrances to the demiplane of ice. Ice elementals emerge from the core of ancient glaciers or rise from foot-thick patches of permafrost. They are aware of portals to their demiplane, but they often choose to traverse terrestrial lands as long as the temperatures remain below freezing. Though not inherently malevolent, they enjoy enclosing warm-blooded foes in ice and watching as the creatures freeze. Some ice elementals even decorate their lairs with these "sculptures."

**_Rivals to Water Elementals_**. Water elementals view themselves as creatures formed of a "pure" element and look down upon ice elementals, which they see as lesser due to their reliance on cold temperatures. Ice elementals, in turn, believe the water elemental's susceptibility to cold gives the ice elemental superiority in physical combat. When the two elemental creatures meet, they posture and taunt each other in Aquan before attacking.

**_Elemental Nature_**. The ice elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

>Summoned by Boreas' faithful, ice elementals protect frozen temples to the deity. While most of these temples are in locations suited to the elementals, ice elementals that serve Boreas allow themselves the discomfort of a temperate climate if it is necessary for protecting a temple. Ice elementals often accompany giants, ogres, and trolls when they seek to conquer southern lands in Boreas' name.
