## Description
---
Cave goats are the size of a spaniel and have dog-like paws rather than hooves. Despite being quadrupeds, they are accomplished climbers of the steep and uneven confines of the Underworld. Cave goats are loyal, if a bit surly, and strong, making them a favorite companion of Underworld travelers.
