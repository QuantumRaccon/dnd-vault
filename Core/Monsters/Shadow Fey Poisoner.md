## Description
---
_It's only after he is lying on the ground, bleeding from an arrow wound in the chest and writhing from the poison seeping through his veins, that the victim sees the pale elf._

**_Accomplished Killers_**. Raised in the dark dwellings of the Shadow Realm, the shadow fey are fleet of foot, quick of thought, and glib of tongue. Just a little extra training with poison, weapons, and magic makes them into uniquely-qualified killers.


**_The Poisoner's Code_**. A shadow fey poisoner never gives the name of an employer, is rarely captured alive, and never kills the target except in self-defense.
