## Description
---
_This massive pale weasel moves with lightning speed. Its white fur is stained red with the crusty remains of its latest meal._

Albino death weasels are ravenous hunters that spend every waking hour in search of food. Farming communities keep watchful eyes out for the signs of albino death weasel dens, since even large livestock, as well as the farmers themselves, are fair game to the creatures. Humanoids that inhabit forests and badlands, in particular, live in fear of albino death weasels.

**_Hunting Beasts_**.  Albino death weasels often serve as scenting and hunting beasts for ogres, hill giants, dark folk, vampires, and creatures of the Plane of Shadow. These trained weasels respond to voice commands and often wear a decorative collar or a distinctive earring.

**_Foiling Invisible Intruders_**.  Their combination of sharp hearing and their ability to detect prey by scent is believed to make them effective in sniffing out invisible intruders. Some wizards and druids rely on the weasels for precisely this reason.
