## Description
---
_An immense bat swoops out of the darkness. Unlike most bats, the creature is a bright smear in the shadows with dirty white fur and red eyes that gleam with a spark of cruel intelligence. All of its exposed skin is bright pink._

Giant albino bats grow to staggering proportions. These bats are marked by Camazotz and aren't simple animals. They gather large gaggles of giant bats and swarms of common bats, claiming swaths of wilderness for their territories.
