## Description
---
>The titanic eel-like creature has delicately dancing frills and flickers of phosphorescence just under its translucent skin. Its mouth opens impossibly wide as it surges forward.

**_Deep Sea Lure_**. The gulper behemoth lives in the waters of the remotest oceans. It lures sea dwellers to their deaths with dancing motes of light within its massive, ballooning gullet. Rumors abound that even a sharp pinprick will deflate the sea monster.


**_Gulper Behemoth's Lair_**. The gulper's lair is filled with brightly-colored and labyrinthine giant corals. Smaller, mutualistic predators swim throughout the lair, keeping it well protected.
