## Description
---
_Mi-go have been described as "vaguely insectlike," but the emphasis belongs on "vaguely." They have stubby wings, multiple limbs, and nightmarish heads, but the resemblance ends there._

The mi-go are a space-faring race of great skill and vast malevolence. They travel in large numbers between worlds, somehow folding space to cover astronomical distances in months rather than decades.

**_Alien Technology_**. Their technology includes mastery of living things, powerful techniques to implant mi-go elements and even minds in alien bodies (or to extract them), and an unparalleled mastery of living tissue in both plant and animal form. While they have their own secrets and goals, they also serve ancient powers from between the stars and carry on an interstellar effort to conquer and spread their species.

**_World Colonizers_**. The mi-go are devoted followers of Shub-Niggurath, the goddess of fecundity and growth, and take their evangelical mission extremely seriously. They colonize entire worlds in Shub-Niggurath's name, and they plant and harvest entire species according to her will.

**_Brain Cylinders_**. One of the apexes of mi-go technology is the brain cylinder, a device that permits the extraction and maintenance of a living brain outside the body. Safely isolated in a mi-go cylinder, a human brain can be transported between the stars, sheltered—mostly—from the psyche-crushing effects of interstellar space. They deploy, fill, and retrieve these cylinders according to schedules and for purposes mysterious to others. Indeed, most of their technology appears either revolting or simply bizarre to humanoids (plant folk are less disquieted by their functioning).
Mi-go merchants exchange psychic tools, surgical instruments, and engineered materials such as solar wings, illuminating lampfruit, and purple starvines (which induce sleep).
