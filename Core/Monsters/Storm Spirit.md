## Description
---
_A floating figure made of crackling energy vibrates and shifts at an alarming rate. While the size of the creature is fixed, its form never seems to settle into a single shape._

Storm spirits are primal guardians created from elemental energy. They are the manifested rage of nature come to destroy those who pollute and corrupt the land. As formless beings made of lightning and thunder, they serve a wide variety of masters, including storm lords (see page 139), elven enchanters (see page 143), and druids.

**_Called by Druids_**. Druids can tap into the wrathful side of nature by performing a ritual to summon a group of storm spirits when they feel the laws of nature have been violated. These spirits feel an affinity for druids filled with righteous anger and serve until vengeance is done. The elementals can be called to aid in battles against undead, necromancy, pollution, harmful mining operations, and any grave injustice committed against the natural world. When the spirits are summoned, the druids give them the name of a person who becomes the hated quarry of the storm spirits.

**_Cannot Be Stopped_**. Once a storm spirit has been given a quarry, it stops at nothing until that enemy or the elemental itself is destroyed. Druids must think carefully before summoning the storm spirit, for there is no way to call back the wrathful elemental once it has been given a target.

**_Elemental Nature_**. A storm spirit doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
