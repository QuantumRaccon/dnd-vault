## Description
---
_The skeletal remains of a man bundled up in seal furs lies in the snow._

**_Forsaken Companion_**. The angry shade of one abandoned and left to die of starvation, thirst, or exposure to the elements, the quiet soul haunts many a frozen campsite, steep cavern, ravine, or deadly trap. Its helplessness, despair, and hatred for those who left it to die followed it beyond death. The quiet soul attempts to kill any who come near so they may join the quiet soul in its isolation. Barely able to move, quiet souls often end up camouflaged by their victims; just one more skeleton in a pile.

**_Death Cult Shrines_**. Occasionally malevolent cults devoted to gods of death, winter, or darkness sacrifice one of their number to become a quiet soul. These quiet souls are given occasional sacrifices, decorated with jewels and finery, and serve as conduits for the voices of dark gods to their faithful. In some cases, they are positioned as statues or posed as supplicants in prayer.

**_Undead Nature_**. A quiet soul doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

>Known in the frozen wastes of the Northlands as "suiksarpok" ("despises others"), the northerly tribes who drive dogsleds across the ice customarily avoid lone tents and frozen camps that answer no hails. However, if fate yields them no other choice, they must take elaborate precautions when making camp, for every tribe has a tale of finding a shelter full of corpses and the discoverers barely escaping the same fate at the hands of a suiksarpok. It is customary for traveling companions to greet one another upon waking in dangerous weather before anyone climbs out of their bedding, just in case.
