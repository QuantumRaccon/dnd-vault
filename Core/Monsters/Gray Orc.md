## Description
---
>The ground erupts into a scrambling flood of orcs, their pale skin decorated with swirls of black resin.

Dwelling deep beneath the ground, gray orcs move in a dark world, only drawn toward the surface by their innate hatred of arcane defilement.
**_Drawn to Magical Corruption_**. Gray orcs are drawn to areas where magic is frequently used or locations marred by magical pollution. Scholars believe the orcs' ancestral home was ravaged by magic, cursing them and driving them deep beneath the surface. They believe this history fuels within the orcs a deep hatred for magic, especially magic that defiles the natural world. For their part, the orcs have neither confirmed nor denied this speculation, though few scholars have been brave enough to approach them about it. Whatever the case, gray orcs grow violent around magic and seek to snuff it out wherever they find it.

**_Synchronized Tribes_**. Gray orcs move and act as one, their training leading their actions to be so synchronized that they appear to think as one. When faced with a major threat or a large magical catastrophe, a group of gray orcs will erupt from the ground in unison to swarm over the source.

**_Silent Hunters_**. Adept at surviving in a dark and quiet world below the ground, gray orcs instinctively know how to move, hunt, and kill without making the slightest sound. When they hunt, gray orcs paint their pale skin with swirls of a mushroom-based black resin. They often form the resin into runes or symbols of their gods as a way of honoring the gods and asking for success on the hunt.
