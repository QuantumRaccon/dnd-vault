## Description
---
>Some demons plot, destroy, and smash their way to power. Hriggala is a simpler demon lord, devouring and destroying all who oppose it. A hundred thousand souls have been extinguished in its jaws.

Hriggala is the great crawling wyrm who serves the Unsated God in malign and destructive forms. Those devotees who claim to have seen the herald of the ghoulish Unsated God in visions tell of an enormous shadow with an ill-defined outline, moving like a wave in the sea and sprouting tendrils that twist and probe like whirlwinds. A low, rhythmic, roaring buzz, as though a droning hive has replaced a beating heart, announces its coming. Hriggala utterly devours any living thing it touches.
**_Growing Void_**. Hriggala embodies all-consuming, maddening, bottomless hunger. Some of those who worship the Unsated God have found transcendence within its depths—others, merely madness and endless gluttony. Ghouls and ghasts, cannibals and madmen, and those who would harness the power in deprivation and gluttony all pay homage to Hriggala as the prophet and factotum of the Unsated God—or as a power in its own right.

**_Invitation to the Feast_**. The demon lord itself urges its followers on with apocalyptic visions experienced at the bitter end of starvation or in acts of unrivaled gluttony, revealing the primacy of those who feast over those who serve and those who are feasted upon.
