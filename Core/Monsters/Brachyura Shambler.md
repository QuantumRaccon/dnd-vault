## Description
---
>The vaguely humanoid creature has an oblong head with a pair of deep-set black eyes, a pair of antennae, and grasping mandibles. The creature is covered in a chitinous shell that is deep red, almost black in color. As it moves, it makes a strange sound, as though it is asking unintelligible questions in gibberish.

**_Purveyors of Mud_**. Brachyura shamblers are foul, vaguely humanoid, semi-intelligent creatures that live in the mud and primarily eat carrion. They eat fresh kills when they can, but they find it easier to eat what is already dead. Because of their filthy living conditions and unsanitary diet, they carry disease, which they easily spread to those they encounter.

**_Related to the Sporous Crab_**. The brachyura often share living space with the [[sporous crab]] and are likely distantly related to them. The crabs are of much lower intelligence, leaving their relationship more like that of a master and pet. The crabs also support the brachyura when their lairs are attacked.
