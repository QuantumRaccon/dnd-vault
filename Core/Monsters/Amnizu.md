## Description
---


Some amnizus have an action that allows them to summon other devils:

**_Summon Devil (1/Day)_**. The amnizu summons **2d4** bearded devils or **1d4** barbed devils. A summoned devil appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the amnizu, acts as an ally of the amnizu, and can't summon other devils. It remains for 1 minute, until the amnizu dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action
