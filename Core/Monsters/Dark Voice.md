## Description
---
_Shadows cling to the black chainmail draping this humanoid's form. Black cloth binds its eyes tightly, but it turns its face as if it can see. The figure's frost-rimmed mace leaves wisps of vapor in the air as the whispering begins, and the light starts to die._

Dark folk arose when a line of human wizards swore allegiance to shadow gods and passed this shadow power to their children. Easily mistaken for humans at a glance, the dark folk long ago diverged from their ancestors.

The most powerful of the dark folk, a dark voice sacrifices both eyes to the truth lurking in the shadows. All dark folk instantly recognize the power and authority vested within a dark voice, though hearing two voices leads to bitter rivalry. Either the local dark folk turn on one another until only one voice remains, or the weaker dark voice sets off to establish a splinter group.

In the rare case that multiple dark voices work together, the dark folk become a terrifying force. A dark voice commands the essence of darkness itself, whispering secrets that snuff light and fill listeners with terror so profound it can be deadly.

**_Shadows among Light_**. Dark folk most often live near humanoid settlements. They worship the powers of darkness and shadow in secret, spreading their corruption in the dead of night and in darkened cellars. They often work nocturnal jobs as undertakers, night soil collectors, alchemists, or night watchmen, escaping the unrelenting glare of the sun.

**_Darkened Blood_**. Sometimes a family line carries the tiniest seed of darkness, and a dark folk is born. These pale children face difficult lives, often singled out and shunned by peers for the dark nature they can't ever fully hide. Though most dark folk look human, dark folk can descend from any humanoid (though they lose all traits associated with their heritage).
