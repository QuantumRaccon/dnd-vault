## Description
---
_This hideous creature has the body of a pale human. Its yellow eyes are slit with vertical pupils, and its wide grin reveals a mouth full of shark's teeth._

**_Hunters from Beyond_**. Mysterious extraplanar creatures, astral snappers hunt humanoids on the Material Plane, but they feed on their victim's innards while concealed in the Astral Plane. They erupt back into the Material Plane from the slain creature once the feast is complete. Though they are most at home in the Astral Plane, they can only get there through killing another creature and can only remain there until they have fed.
**_Servants or Parasites_**. The few scholars familiar with these creatures speculate that they may have come into the world either attached to or in the wake of far greater creatures from beyond the stars, and perhaps they serve such godlike beings in some way.
**_Strange Hungers_**. Astral snappers hunt by means of stealth and ambush, while seeking out lone travelers. When the astral snapper enters the victim's body by opening a portal in it to the Astral Plane, many of the creatures believe the astral snapper has simply broken off its attack and vanished. They count themselves lucky right up until the first pains of being devoured from the inside strike them.
