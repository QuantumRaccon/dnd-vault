## Description
---
>These glyph-covered metal spiders slowly crawl over the cracked temples of beings beyond the minds of mortals.

Dread walker excavators are spider-shaped constructs developed to protect and excavate ancient, magical ruins. Excavators are found deep underwater or in wastelands, crawling over monuments built hundreds of years ago.
**_Alien Minds_**. The minds of the excavators are completely mysterious, their instructions indecipherable. Excavators are able to communicate with one another, and supposedly with their masters, but the transmission path of this communication is unknown.

**_Dread Eye_**. The excavatorÃ­s central eye shines complicated diagrams atop the stonework of ancient ruins, imprinting alien glyphs atop those carved hundreds of years previously. Some believe the excavators contain vast knowledge of ancient magic and lost civilizations, and sages greatly desire destroyed excavators, hoping to extract this knowledge from their remains. None have yet been successful, and many have been driven mad by the attempt.

**_Construct Nature_**. A dread walker excavator doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

>Few know the exact origin of the excavators, but many believe them to be remnants of the Great Mage Wars, a horrible conflict between powerful and unbridled magocracies that took place centuries ago. Their creators were clearly skilled in the arcane arts, but the goals and intentions the creators embedded into the excavators are unknown. Though the creators are likely long dead, the excavators still perform their instructions long after their masters' demise. Others believe the creators of the excavators exist still, silently pulling the strings behind the rise and fall of empires while they study the mysterious origins of the Dread Walkers over the centuries.
