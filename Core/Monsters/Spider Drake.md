## Description
---
_Hidden in the stalactites near the ceiling of a webâ€‘filled cave, a skulking half dragon, half arachnid waits to ensnare its prey._

**_Savage Hunters_**. Spider drakes are more primal than their true dragon cousins, following an instinctual desire to hunt and trap prey.


**_Beautiful Treasures_**. Like its kin, the spider drake collects a hoard. Instead of displaying the hoard openly, the spider drake wraps its prizes in silk, encasing the valuables and the body of the hunted creature together. Opening the treasures of the lair often reveals the spider drake's most recent kills.
