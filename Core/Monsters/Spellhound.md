## Description
---
>A shimmering coat and a ridged snout distinguish the hound from other monstrous canines.

**_Vindictive Origins_**. The first spellhounds began as nothing more than ordinary scent hounds. When the master of the hounds was tormented by a hag, he struck a deal with a powerful fey lord, requesting that his stock be blessed with the ability to hunt the witch. The hounds were returned to him, empowered and mutated, but capable of making short work of the hag nonetheless. After the houndmaster was ostracized for keeping monstrous pets, he grew resentful and concluded that the fey lord had wronged him. He arrogantly set out with his spellhounds after the fey lord that had created them, but he never returned. Ever since, spellhounds have been kept as prized pets by warring fey or set loose in fey-inhabited forests to prey on lonely spellcasters.

**_Magical Predators_**. Spellhounds have olfactory capabilities that allow them to sense the "odor" of spellcasters. This, combined with their spell-repelling coats and their magic-disrupting howls, makes them a menace for anyone with even a minor arcane faculty.
