## Description
---
>This composite creature combines a ruddy-skinned gnome's upper body and a hell hound's reddish black body. Stitches and glowing runes where the gnome and hell hound are fused demonstrate the creature's unnaturalness.

Infernal centaurs are a response by various cults to the physical might possessed by the centaurs of the nearby plains. Rather than a melding of human and horse, though, these centaurs combine hell-bound gnomes with [[hell hound \|hell hounds]]. The composite creature combines gnome cunning with the speed and fiery breath belonging to hell hounds. The ritual that creates an infernal centaur infuses the creature with a peculiar brutality.
**_Unnatural_**. Infernal centaurs are not naturally occurring. However, as the ritual to create these centaurs improves and spreads among cults, more gnomes who desire hellish power submit to the ritual, increasing the number of these centaurs.
