## Description
---
>A writhing mass of hundreds of rubbery, blue-grey tentacles rises from a human sized pair of legs ending in elephantine feet. Each tentacle ends in an eerily human-looking mouth.

**_Damned Pipers_**. Vangsluagh create a din everywhere they go; the mouths on their tentacles perpetually scream, whistle, bleat, growl, and cry. Even in instances where a vangsluagh may want a quiet entrance or stealthy ambush, their own bodies betray them. Stories have emerged from their magic-blasted homeland of vangsluagh that are capable of silencing the noise surrounding them.

**_Defilers of Beauty_**. Vangsluagh despise pretty things, be they creature, object, or structure. Given the opportunity, a vangsluagh prefers spending its time smashing beautiful things to bits. The absence of beauty doesn't always calm these creatures, however. They target living creatures as a priority in such occurrences.

>Creatures maddened in the shadow of Uthul Vangslagish eventually transform into vangsluagh, the doom singing, wandering heralds of their dread parent. Vangsluagh wander the lands of the Wasted West, spreading discord whenever they come into contact with mortals. Some sages contend that Uthul-Vangslagish will call all of its children home when it is time to end the world with its song.
