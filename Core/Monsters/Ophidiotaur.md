## Description
---
>This creature could be mistaken for a large centaur if not for the black and green scales covering its body and its cobra-like head. Its hiss sounds like a hundred angry vipers, and the venom dripping from creature's long fangs sizzles as it lands.

**_Born from Corruption_**. An ophidiotaur is created when a centaur is transformed via a foul ritual that combines its form with that of a venomous serpent. Most centaurs do not survive the process, but those that do can reproduce naturally, potentially creating even more of these serpentine monstrosities.

**_Servants of Serpents_**. Ophidiotaurs serve evil nagas, [[serpentfolk of Yig]] (Creature Codex), and even dragons. While they make poor guards, ophidiotaurs excel as shock troops and mounts for serpentfolk. Ophidiotaurs that survive the fall of their masters escape into the wilds and form loose-knit tribes ruled by the strongest individual. [[centaur \|Centaurs]] loathe and pity ophidiotaurs in equal measure and put down the abominations whenever they can.
