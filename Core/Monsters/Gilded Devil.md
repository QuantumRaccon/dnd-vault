## Description
---
_This tall, bronze-complexioned man is abnormally long-limbed and clad in armor of stained and battered coins. His wiry frame is festooned with mismatched bracelets, rings, and necklaces, each gaudier than the last. The easy smile on his face is cold with envy._

**_Servants of Mammon_**. Rarely seen in their natural form outside of Hell, gilded devils are the servitors of Mammon, archdevil of greed. They tempt and corrupt with promises of wealth, power, and fame, twisting mortal greed into sure damnation.

**_Impression of Wisdom_**. When pursuing a mortal of high standing, gilded devils prefer unassuming appearances, molding their flesh and gaudy trappings to make themselves look the parts of wise advisers, canny merchants, or sly confidants.

**_Fond of Gold and Jewels_**. Even in their humblest form, gilded devils always wear a piece of golden jewelry or a jeweled button or ornament.
