## Description
---


The yuan-ti has advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to hide.

The yuan-ti can shed its skin as a bonus action to free itself from a grapple, shackles, or other restraints. If the yuan-ti spends 1 minute eating its shed skin, it regains hit points equal to half its hit point maximum.
