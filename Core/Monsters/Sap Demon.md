## Description
---
_When a sap demon leaves a tree, its milky amber fluid oozes from an axe wound on a stout maple's trunk and shapes itself into a small, vaguely humanoid form on the forest floor beside the tree. This languid creature half walks and half flows forward, implacably following the axe wielder's path to certain revenge._

**_Tree Oozes_**. Sap demons aren't true demons, but rather are intelligent oozes that form when an enchanted tree is cut or injured. Though typically Small, the larger the sap source is, the larger the resulting creature can be. Over a few hours, they pool into a shape that vaguely resembles their tree's attacker: for instance, if the tree cutter wore a hat, then a hat may be incorporated into the sap demon's overall shape. The similarity is faint at best; no one would ever confuse a sap demon for the creature it hunts, because its shape has no sharp features or color other than amber.

**_Called to Vengeance_**. Sap demons can pummel their prey with partially-crystallized fists, but they especially enjoy claiming the weapon that wounded their tree and wielding it to deliver a final blow. Once their prey is destroyed, most sap demons return to their tree, but not all do. Some are curious or malevolent enough to explore the world further.

**_Reckless Possessors_**. A sap demon can possess another creature by grappling it and oozing down its throat. Once inside, the sap demon dominates its host and makes it bleed as the tree bled. Since the sap demon takes no damage when its host is wounded, it's free to be as reckless as it likes. It might wander into a town to cause trouble. However, no matter how its new body is bandaged or cured, it never stops bleeding slowly. If the host body is killed, the sap demon oozes out during the next hour and either returns to its tree or seeks another host.
