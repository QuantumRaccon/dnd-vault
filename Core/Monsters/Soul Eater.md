## Description
---
_Creatures of variable appearance, soul eaters conjoin fleshy elements with ectoplasmic forms._

**_Called from the Abyss_**. Soul eaters are summoned from the Abyss and other extraplanar ports of call where they can freely barter for prey. They always have a mental link with their summoner, and often seek to destroy them.

**_Devour Essences_**. Soul eaters do not devour crude flesh, instead feasting on a victim's soul and spirit.

**_Hatred of the Sun God_**. They bear a particular antipathy for followers of the sun god, and they will go to great lengths to kill his clergy, even defying the wishes of their summoners on occasion.
