## Description
---
_A soft-bodied, iridescent creature floats by, tentacles rippling along its back as it quests for its next meal._

Arcanaphage are commonly found in places imbued with magic, their colorful skin rhythmically pulsating as they graze on arcane energies.
**_Magivore_**. The arcanaphage diet consists exclusively of magic. It has no mouth; it feeds by absorbing nearby magical energy into a series of ropy tentacles that run the length of its body. With enough time, an arcanaphage can slowly slurp all of the power out of magical objects, traps, or spells permanently imbuing an area. Most arcanaphage are about the size of a large dog, though especially well-fed specimens the size of draft horses have been reported.
**_Docile Unless Angered_**. If left to feed undisturbed, an arcanaphage typically ignores its surroundings. However, when it feels threatened or when food is scarce and it senses magic nearby, it viciously attacks.
**_Unwitting Guardians_**. Its ability to neutralize magic in its immediate area, combined with its calm demeanor, makes an arcanaphage an excellent guardian against a wizard's ire. Some warlords even bring pet arcanaphage to battle as protection from spellcasters, although this is a gamble since the creatures like to sit on and absorb power from unattended magical objects, like a warlord's heirloom weapon, and can release a torrent of magical energy when slain.
