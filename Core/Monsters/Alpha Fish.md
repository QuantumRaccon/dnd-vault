## Description
---
>A fish as large as a rowboat serenely floats beneath the surface of the water, its flowing fins and iridescent scales shimmering in the waves. When disturbed, it attacks with a ferocity unexpected of such a delicate-looking creature.

Alpha fish are solitary and extremely territorial creatures. They are always found alone, except during the few short weeks of mating season each year when schools of the fish gather.
**_Dazzling Dominance_**. Before attacking, alpha fish often attempt to intimidate potential rivals or predators away by flaring their colorful fins to make themselves appear much larger. If successful, they usually refrain from attacking.

**_Aggressive_**. If intimidation doesn't work, alpha fish defend their chosen homes by viciously attacking. They have been known to attack creatures much larger than themselves and, occasionally, objects they don't recognize.

**_Valuable_**. Many aristocrats seek the beautiful, shimmering fish as pets in massive, personal aquariums, and the alpha fish's scales are valuable spell components.


> [!INFO] Alpha Fish Scales
>Alpha fish scales are coveted spell components. When a spellcaster uses an alpha fish scale as a spell component while casting an enchantment or illusion spell, the spellcaster can increase the DC of the spell by 1 or increase the DC of the Intelligence ([[Investigation]]) check to determine if the illusion is false by 1. If the spell is 4th level or higher, the scale is consumed in the casting of the spellâ€”otherwise, it remains.
