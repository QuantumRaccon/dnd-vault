## Description
---
Favoring linen robes of crimson or black to hide the stains and spatters of its medium, a blood mage about its work might look like a beggar and smell like an abattoir, but the power coursing through its veins makes such concerns beneath the blood mage's notice. Drawing power from bloodletting, both its own and that of others, makes most civilizations fear and despise the blood mage, necessitating that it practice its dark arts in secret. Each period of renewed study is usually accompanied by disappearances among the most vulnerable. A trail of exsanguinated corpses follows.
> [!INFO] Blood Mages in Midgard
>Practiced openly in the Blood Kingdom of Morgau and tolerated in the Mharoti dragon empire, blood magic is a common threat in Midgard's darker lands. Blood mages are often found allied with or creating [[crimson tusked ogre \|crimson tusked ogres]] (see page 279) and [[blood zombie \|blood zombies]] (see page 393), and are on good terms with most vampires, liches, and followers of Marena, the Red Goddess. When using the Midgard setting, change the blood mage's spells to the following (see "Fifth Edition Appendix" in the _Midgard World Book_ [^1]):
>Cantrips (at will): [[acid splash]], blood tide*, [[mage hand]], [[mending]], [[prestidigitation]]
>1st level (4 slots): [[charm person]], [[false life]], stanch*, weapon of blood*
>2nd level (3 slots): bloodshot*, [[hold person]]
>3rd level (3 slots): blood armor*, [[dispel magic]], [[fly]], [[vampiric touch]]
>4th level (3 slots): [[evard's black tentacles \|black tentacles]], [[blight]]
>5th level (2 slots): sanguine horror*, [[scrying]]
