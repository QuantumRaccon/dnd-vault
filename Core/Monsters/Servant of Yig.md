## Description
---
_This massive ophidian is a hideous amalgam of man and snakeâ€”a fanged humanoid head with expressionless features sits atop the shimmering coils of a large, squamous body. As the creature hisses, its full lips open to speak in the rich, vibrant tone of an unknown tongue, forgotten long before the kingdoms of man arose._

**_Progeny of the Serpent God_**. Servants of Yig are monstrous humanoid-serpent hybrids that often serve as sentinels and assassins for the dreadful Old One Yig and his horrid devotees. The speckled, brownish hide and obscene stench of these long, scaly creatures contrasts the cold and otherworldly beauty of their emotionless countenance.

**_Abhorrent Executioners_**. Legends speak of a curse that dooms anyone foolish enough to betray Yig or raise his ire. Indeed, those condemned by the Great Old One are visited by these odious servants to meet an unpleasant end. When these unnerving creatures aren't engaged as masterfully covert hunters, they serve as the duly deranging guardians of dark, forbidden places.

**_The Swollen Death_**. The Servants of Yig are the Old One's children and were created in his horrible image. Their unholy venom causes the body of a creature slain by the poison to swell until its plump flesh ruptures with a repulsive "pop."
