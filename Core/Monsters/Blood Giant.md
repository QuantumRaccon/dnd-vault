## Description
---
_A towering frame of bone wrapped in vessels of frozen blood, like a tree covered in crimson vines, blocks the way._

Blood giants are formidable sentries, tireless in their oath to guard eldritch places and keep trespassers out.

**_Sworn Guardians_**. Blood giants belong to a primordial tribe of giants that swore an oath to a god long forgotten by men. They stand as guardians to secret holy places of great power and as wardens to keep ancient enemies of their god from ever seeing the light of day.


**_Blood Magic_**. Centuries ago, the blood of these creatures was mixed with the blood of the god to whom they swore their oath. That oath, keeps their bodies in a state between death and life, causing magical blood to endlessly flow through their bodies long after their mortal flesh has fallen away. They have great control over this blood, hardening it to an ice-like state and liquefying it at will. The blood giant's weapons are all made by this process.


**_Eternal Guardian Nature_**. A blood giant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
