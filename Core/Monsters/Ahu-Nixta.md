## Description
---
_Hidden deep within its clockwork armor, the creature is a shapeless horror from beyond the stars._

**_Clockwork Armor_**. Weak and easy prey in their natural state, the ahu-nixta long ago mastered the art of clockwork design, building armor that could carry them through the voids between stars and bolster their physical abilities.

**_Always Murmuring Praise_**. The ahu-nixta constantly murmur praise of dark gods, though this sound is somewhat muffled by their armored shell. In large groups, their voices always offer the same praise, like a dark chorus.
