## Description
---
>The creature has a maddened expression on its almost featureless face. Its vaguely humanoid body is covered in lumpy, grayishgreen skin, and its head sits on a long neck. Its long arms end in vicious claws, and it stands on sharp hooves.

**_Leaders of Carnivores_**. [[ghast of leng \|Ghasts of Leng]] (Creature Codex) who claw their way up, surviving rounds of feeding frenzies, become greater ghasts. They are stronger, tougher, and usually taller than their peers, who look to them for leadership. The greater ghasts of Leng do not, however, provide structured leadership. Instead, they chaotically direct flow of their hungry kin, pointing out prey and keeping the lesser ghasts in line. They are, in essence, the biggest bullies in a pack of scavenger bullies.
