## Description
---
_This withered creature wrapped in gore-stained rags. They can pull back a tattered hood to reveal glowing eyes hungry with bloodlust._

In certain tribes, the breaking of local taboos invites terrible retribution from ancestral spirits, especially if the transgressor was a tribal leader or elder. The transgressor is cursed and cast out from the tribe, and then hunted and executed.

**_Bound Remains Entombed_**. The body is wrapped head to toe in lamba cloth to soothe the spirit and to bind it within the mortal husk, then sealed in a tomb far from traditional burial grounds so none may disturb it and its unclean spirit does not taint the blessed dead.

**_Slow Ritual Cleansing_**. Each such body is visited every ten years as the tribe performs the famadihana ritual, replacing the lamba bindings and soothing the suffering of the ancestors. Over generations, this ritual expiates their guilt, until at last the once.accursed ancestor is admitted through the gates of the afterlife. If a spirit's descendants abandon their task, or if the sealed tomb is violated, the accursed soul becomes an angatra.

**_Angry Spirit_**. The creature's form becomes animated by a powerful and malicious ancestor spirit and undergoes a horrible metamorphosis within its decaying cocoon. Its fingernails grow into scabrous claws, its skin becomes hard and leathery, and its withered form is imbued with unnatural speed and agility. Within days, the angatra gathers strength and tears its bindings into rags. It seeks out its descendants to to share the torment and wrath it endured while its spirit lingered.
