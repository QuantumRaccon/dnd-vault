## Description
---
_A dragonborn draped in flowing robes cracks its knuckles, causing sparks of elemental magic to spray in all directions._

Dragons carry the power of the elements in their blood, and some dragonborn also carry this supernatural gift.

**_Arcane Artillerists_**. Most dragonborn elementalists are specially trained soldiers, used on the field of battle to protect their infantry and cavalry allies. Elementalists specialize in combat spells that utilize a specific element, wasting no effort on broadening their horizons with utility spells.


> [!INFO] Dragonborn in Midgard
>For most in Midgard, speaking the word dragonborn conjures images of the Mharoti Dragon Empire. They see the armies marching across the fields of their homelands, the wyverns soaring through the skies, the fire raining down upon the earth. To them, dragonborn herald death.
>Most dragonborn resent this, of course. Like any other people, they are not inclined toward evil or good—but those within the Dragon Empire are subject to the sultan's dreams of conquest. Because the Dragon Empire holds scalykind above all other races, intelligent creatures like true dragons, dragonborn, and half‑dragons—even kobolds—receive superior education and martial training to the rest of the empire's peoples.
>These dragonkin often go on to become officers in the Dragon Empire's mighty legions, desiring to amass even more power for themselves by conquering Midgard and the Southlands. Dragonborn elementalists and light cavalry are part of the Dragon Empire's akinji military caste. In peacetime, the akinji are its landholders, merchants, priests, mayors, headmen, ship captains, and minor figures, filling a role similar to landed gentry elsewhere. Dragonborn heavy cavalry within the empire are part of the timarli military caste, which is comprised entirely of minor nobles, generals, and ambassadors. Many dragonborn heavy cavalry serve the sultan directly as advisors, castellans, seers, or spies.
