## Description
---
_This strong and handsome warrior has a snarling hyena's face at the back of its head._

**_Dark Appetites_**. Kishi are two-faced male demons perpetually driven by their voracious appetites, carnal or otherwise, with a predilection for female humanoids. Kishi frequently behead, scalp, or skin their conquests and decorate their shields with their trophies.

**_Hats and Veils_**. Kishi demons masquerade as muscular warriors or glib storytellers, wearing elaborate headdresses or clan veils to hide the demonic hyena face on the back of their head. Deadly Charmers. They use magical and nonmagical means of persuasion to inveigle women into their embrace, but their trysts always end in a grisly feast upon their victim's flesh.




The kishi demon has a 35 percent chance of summoning one kishi demon.
