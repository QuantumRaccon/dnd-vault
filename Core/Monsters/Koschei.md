## Description
---
_This wizened old man is little more than wrinkled skin stretched taut over bones. His long, wispy white hair is surmounted by a crown, and he wears a gold-trimmed black robe. A large sword with a twisted blade rests in his nearly skeletal hand._

Koschei, the king of an ancient land, feared death so much that he turned to the darkest magic to stave off his demise. He discovered a means to protect himself from both time and injury, and transformed himself into something both greater and less than human. Similar to the transformation into a lich, Koschei became an immortal fiend. He remains terrified of death, and his appearance has become withered and ancient despite his vigor.

**_Undying Secret_**. Koschei cheated death by separating his soul from his body and hiding it in an iron chest, buried beneath a tree on an island. In the chest is a rabbit, which immediately tries to flee if the chest is opened. If the rabbit is killed, a duck flies out from the chest and tries to escape (use hawk statistics, can't attack). If the duck dies it lays a green egg, inside of which is a golden needle that contains Koschei's soul. As long as his soul is safely hidden away, time and death slide past the undying king.


**_Koschei's Lair_**. Koschei's lair is the crumbling remains of his ancient castle. Though there are still finery and riches contained within the structure, Koschei seems oblivious to the march of time threatening to demolish his home.
