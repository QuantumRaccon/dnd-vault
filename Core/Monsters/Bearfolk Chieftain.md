## Description
---
_With white fur and a sturdy ax, bearfolk chieftains use their size and appearance to threaten strangers. Those who show courage are often welcomed to join the tribe around a fire and feast on seal meat._

**_Balanced Strength_**. Ruling even a small clan of bearfolk requires patience, sagacity, and ferocity in equal measure, and chieftains who last more than a season display mastery of such a balance. What tales the skalds do not tell of their deeds can be read in their scars, which they display with pride. Always flanked by loyal guards willing to enforce their will, bearfolk chieftains must nonetheless remain ready to wade into battle at a moment's notice against the horrors that lurk in their frozen wilderness or the challenges of their would-be successors.

**_Axe of Rulership_**. Each chieftain owns (and often wields) an axe of some kind as a totem of rulership. Stealing a bearfolk chieftain's axe is a crime that usually results in death or exile.

> [!INFO] Bearfolk in Midgard
>In the Midgard setting, bearfolk are rare but respected. They thrive both in the Northlands and in the Shadow Realm, where many of a chieftain's strongest guards (often referred to by their northern name, "huskarls") are expected to go on seasonal rambles over wide territory. Their fondness for wandering and their honest nature makes them natural friends to the dwarves and humans against giants and ogres.
