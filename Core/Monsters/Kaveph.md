## Description
---
>This massive purple creature, with legs like tree trunks and a pair of enormous arms, shakes the ground with its footsteps. Its eyeless head is bulbous, with an elongated mouth that is almost snout-like.

**_Allies of the Ghasts of Leng_**. The kaveph are massive creatures that originate from the lightless underground of the Plateau of Leng. They are usually found in the company of the [[greater ghast of leng \|greater ghasts of Leng]], acting as powerful allies as the greater ghasts try to overtake prey. The kaveph are seen as expendable by the ghasts of Leng, and they are often sent in first to try and soften up more powerful enemies before the ghasts swarm in to devour them.

**_Alien Ecology_**. Like most of the creatures from the Plateau of Leng, the kaveph have an alien intelligence that is difficult to understand or study. When not serving the [[ghast of Leng \|ghasts of Leng]] (Creature Codex), they seem to follow no leader, and their interactions with one another are puzzling and often violent. At one moment they might coexist with others in peace, then—often for incomprehensible reasons—they lash out against each other in some sort of mindless blood frenzy until only one of them stands. Those that survive to regroup go on as if the fight never happened. This blood frenzy might be directed at other members of a family, members of outside groups, or even hunting parties. They do not seem to exhibit this behavior when under the guidance of the ghasts of Leng.
