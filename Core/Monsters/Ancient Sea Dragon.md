## Description
---
_This aquamarine dragon has a shark's head that tapers off into a sleek eel-like body. Its large fins double as wings._

**_Divine Dragons_**. Sea dragons are the children of the ocean, and believe they are semi-divine beings, worthy of worship. Given their size and power, they may be right; certainly, they are often companions or steeds to gods of the sea.
Despite the solemn duties the sea dragons invoke thanks to their lineage, they are extremely whimsical. While these immense creatures are playful, their games can shatter hulls and drown sailors. The sea dragons course through the waves with tangible joy as they hunt whales and entire schools of tuna.

**_Sunken Hoards_**. Sea dragons love collecting treasure, especially prize the sunken treasure-filled hulls of ships lost to storm, battle, or their own handiwork. While they appreciate all wealth, they prefer hardy items that can stand up to long exposure to sea water. Precious metals and gemstones add a dramatic luster to the dragon's lair when they catch stray beams of light. Sea dragons take any more perishable treasures and place them on a reef-altar, to dissolve in the sea as a tithe to the sea gods.

**_Sunken Memorials_**. A sea dragon's lair is littered with meticulously arranged ships consigned to the deeps. These wrecks are often artfully smashed to allow the treasures in the hold to spill out onto the sea floor. It may seem haphazard, but it displays a complex aesthetic that only other sea dragons can truly appreciate. Because they arrange these wrecks so carefully, a dragon notices immediately if its hoard is disturbed.

> [!INFO] Priests of Seggotan
>Every sea dragon is devoted to the dragon god of the sea. As a result, many sea dragons use the innate spellcasting variant [^1]. Sea dragons favor spells that manipulate water or the weather, emulate storms, deal lightning or cold damage, divine the future, or conjure sea creatures to fight alongside the sea dragon.

> [!INFO] Sea Dragons in Midgard
>Sea dragons are the offspring of Seggotan, the dragon god of time and the sea. A sea dragon shares its god's idea that everything in the sea is the property of Seggotan, and they expect lesser beings to respect that truth.
>The sea dragons are among the most powerful allies of the Mharoti Empire, securing seaways and acting as a communion point for the tidal priests. Thankfully for the Empire's enemies, the most ancient sea dragons are too consumed with their contemplation of time and their inscrutable duties in the depths of the ocean to make war.


**_Sea Dragon's Lair_**. Sea dragons dwell in lairs dwell in lairs beneath the waves: ocean fissures and caves, lightless trenches full of strange rock formations, and sheltered reefs of cultivated coral.
Whatever the place, it's dedicated to the worship of sea gods. Despite the draconic instinct for seclusion and protection when choosing a lair, sea dragons always choose lairs relatively close to humanoid trade routes and abundant supplies of fish.
The sky surrounding a sea dragon's lair is perpetually stormy, and the seas run high. If a captain is courageous, these high winds and swift-running currents can cut significant time off a voyage.




[^1]: A young or older dragon can innately cast a number of spells equal to its Charisma modifier. Each spell can be cast once per day, requiring no material components, and the spell's level can be no higher than one-third the dragon's challenge rating (rounded down). The dragon's bonus to hit with spell attacks is equal to its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus. The dragon's spell save DC equals 8 + its proficiency bonus + its Charisma bonus.
