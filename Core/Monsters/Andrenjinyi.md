## Description
---
_A gigantic, black-headed snake is over 60 feet long and sheathed in brilliant scales, each andrenjinyi is splashed with vibrant patterns of every imaginable color. The air around these serpents is heavy, redolent of the quenched red desert after a torrential thunderstorm._

Andrenjinyi are the descendants of the Rainbow Serpent, the first and greatest spirit of the world's beginning. The Rainbow Serpent's children are dichotomous nature spirits of land and sky, sun and rain, male and female, and birth and destruction.

**_Last of their Kind_**. The Rainbow Serpent shed andrenjinyi like cast-off scales during her primordial wanderings, but she has created no more since she ascended to the stars. While andrenjinyi are ageless fertility spirits, they cannot themselves reproduce; each one is an irreplaceable link to primeval creation.

**_Hunt and Transform_**. Andrenjinyi are naturally aquatic, preferring to live in deep, fresh, life-giving rivers and lakes. The serpents usually attack intruders unless they approach with the correct rites or offerings, which require a successful DC 20 Intelligence ([[Religion]]) check.
Andrenjinyi hunt as other animals do, but they transform devoured prey into unique species with their Transmuting Gullet ability, creating mixed gender pairs. An andrenjinyi's sacred pool and surroundings often shelters a menagerie of strange and beautiful animals.

**_Demand Obedience and Ritual_**. When offered rituals and obedience, andrenjinyi sometimes protect nearby communities with drought-breaking rains, cures for afflictions, or the destruction of rivals. Revered andrenjinyi take offense when their petitioners break fertility and familial edicts, such as prohibitions on incest, rape, and matricide, but also obscure obligations including soothing crying infants and the ritual sacrifice of menstrual blood. Punishments are malevolently disproportionate, often inflicted on the whole community and including baking drought, flooding rains, petrification, pestilence, and animalistic violence. Thus, tying a community's well-being to an andrenjinyi is a double-edged sword.

> [!INFO] The Rainbow Serpent
>When the flat, featureless earth slept untouched by plants, animals, or gods, the Rainbow Serpent awoke and shaped the world with her mountainous bodyâ€”rivers her winding tracks, lakes the hollows where she slept, and hills the remnants of her burrowing. When she tired of wandering, she gave birth to all of the land's animals.
>The Rainbow Serpent then made laws for all to obey and turned lawbreakers into mountains and hills, never to walk the world again. Those who kept the laws were given humanoid forms and sentience. Her work completed, the Rainbow Serpent now sleeps in the stars, leaving her spirit-children, the andrenjinyi, watching over creation.
>Clerics who follow the Rainbow Serpent must choose the Life domain.
