## Description
---
_Decomposing warriors arise from among the slain upon the battlefield. Their armor is green with verdigris, and a black miasma emanates from them. Their eye sockets are hollow, dimly glowing a pallid green, and their weapons absorb light._

**_Countering the Valkyrie_**. Nidhogg, the serpent glutting on the corpses of the fallen while tangled amid the roots of Yggdrasil, has taken issue with the valkyrie poaching the best from the battlefield. He relishes the hatred of those who die with anger in their hearts, turning them into his captains in the fight against the valkyrie.

**_Immortal Rage_**. Nidhogg places a curse upon those who were slain with hatred and rage burning within them, so that mortal men forget them utterly and their name is stricken from song. The tveirherjar have but one purpose: to corrupt the [[einherjar]] (Tome of Beasts, p. 167) with that same curse.

**_Rebirth From Death_**. Tveirherjar are born into the dusk on the evening of their mortal demise. They stand up from amidst the gore and shamble away into the night. They cannot remember how they came to be, only that they have been given a new, higher purpose: to save their fallen comrades from Valhalla.

**_Undead Nature_**. The tveirherjar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
