## Description
---
Oth who live for centuries eventually transform into droth. These huge, undulating piles of ooze travel from world to world, creating the zolvs wherever they are needed. Droth have a calming effect on living creatures, and their rippling surface is not unlike a great body of water. Droth have a different sense of time than other shoth and communicating simple messages with them can take days or weeks. Droth are revered by the sooze and the oth, as they resemble Shoth itself. Droth, in turn, bolster the abilities of the lesser shoth.

**_Made From Their Bodies_**. The dissolving pools (zolvs) of the shoth are made from a portion of a droth. A droth who has recently created a zolv remains weakened (maximum hp halved)) for several days. For this reason, the droth are heavily guarded during and after the zolv production process.
