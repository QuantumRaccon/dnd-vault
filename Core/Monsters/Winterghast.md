## Description
---
>This blue-skinned corpse, covered in frosty patches with a ridge of icicles down its spine, lumbers forward.

**_Eater of Frozen Corpses_**. While most types of ghouls prefer freshly killed meat, winterghasts enjoy flesh afflicted with frostbite or gangrene. Since the opportunity for meals is diminished in less populated tundra, winterghasts are careful to avoid spawning additional winterghasts through the disease they inflict. This outlook also prevents winterghasts from gathering in large numbers, but they sometimes form clans for mutual protection and to keep other winterghasts from hunting in their territories. When times become lean, these clans often tear each other apart through infighting, and the survivors scatter to hunt in solitude.

**_Scorned by Darakhul_**. Even from their underground kingdoms, darakhul are aware of the existence of winterghasts but believe them to be just as brutish as lesser [[ghast \|ghasts]] and [[ghoul \|ghouls]]. Much of the darakhul's attitude derives from their inherent sense of superiority, since very few darakhul have encountered winterghasts. If not for the winterghasts' remote location, the darakhul would have attempted to wipe them out long ago. Some darakhul necromancers have researched the creation of darakhul-winterghast hybrids, eradicating the winterghasts' susceptibility to fire and their hunger for frostbitten flesh. These necromancers have had little success finding test subjects, delaying a darakhul conquest of arctic lands.

**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. A winterghast doesn't require air or sleep.
