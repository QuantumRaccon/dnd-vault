## Description
---
>At the heart of a violent storm, a young woman lies huddled in despair. Her skin is translucent as if made of water, and her tears float up from her face to join the storm above her.

A storm maiden is a spiteful elemental that pulls powerful storms into the world through a portal connected to her shrine. Blinded by anguish, she seeks to erase any trace of those who betrayed her.
**_Primordial Sacrifice_**. Long ago, this woman was offered up to powerful spirits to ward off drought and famine. She served her role faithfully. Her shrine was maintained by a ritual of devotion performed by the descendants of those she loved, but it was eventually abandoned. Now, some transgression against her abandoned shrine has drawn the maiden back to the world.

**_Abating the Storm_**. A region plagued by a storm maiden experiences regular flooding and random tornadoes and lightning strikes. A community may yet atone for their ancestral betrayal by performing a long-forgotten ritual at the maiden's shrine. If appeased, the storms end, and the maiden's alignment changes from evil to good. An appeased maiden may go on to protect the region for generations, as long as her shrine is maintained, or she might wander to other regions, seeking communities in need who understand the importance of maintaining her shrine.

**_Elemental Nature_**. A storm maiden doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
