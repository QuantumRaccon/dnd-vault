## Description
---
_Hidden in the dappled shadows of the tree's leaves, the elf 's leather bandolier jingles softly. Leather armor dyed to match its surroundings, the nearly invisible archer removes a vial from the bandolier, quickly attaching it to an arrow. The well-kept bow does not creak as the bowstring is drawn._

Mixing their knowledge of dangerous chemicals with their extensive weapon skills, these elves are devastating from afar.

**_A Sharp Smell_**. Try as they might, alchemist archer elves cannot eliminate the scent of their various acids and tinctures. Their distinctive scent makes them easier to find by creatures with an acute sense of smell.
