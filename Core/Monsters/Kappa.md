## Description
---
_Lurking in the water is a strange child-sized humanoid that resembles a bizarre cross between a turtle, a lizard, and a monkey. It has a beak-like mouth, scaly reptilian skin, clawed and webbed hands, and a turtle-like shell on its back. In the top of its head is a bowl-like depression filled with water._

**_Tricksters and Trouble-Makers_**. Kappa are impish fey spirits that live in the rivers, lakes, and swamps of the eastern lands. Mischievous, they will often play lewd, childish pranks on those passing close to their homes, such as pulling down a traveler's breeches or stealing its clothing while it is swimming. They love the taste of horse and cow flesh and can drag the large animals into the water to drown before sucking out the creatures' entrails. Dark-hearted kappas will attempt to wrestle and drown innocent mortals.

**_Weak Spot_**. The source of a kappa's power is the bowl-like cavity on the top of its head, which is filled with water from the river, lake, or other body of water where it resides. If this bowl ever becomes empty, the kappa is weakened and it will refill the bowl as soon as possible. Kappa are both scrupulously polite and not very bright. If approached with courtesy, a person bowing deeply can trick a kappa into returning the gesture, so that the water pours out of its head bowl.

**_Favorite Foodstuffs_**. A kappa's favorite food is the cucumber. Wise travelers who must cross a bridge over a river inhabited by a kappa will throw cucumbers carved with their names and those of their companions into the water to assuage the creature's appetite. Farmers have been known to befriend kappas with regular gifts of cucumbers, melons, eggplants, and the occasional cow. In return, the kappas may irrigate the farmer's fields, provide fresh fish, or teach the farmer how to set broken bones.
