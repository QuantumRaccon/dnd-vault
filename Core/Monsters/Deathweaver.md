## Description
---
>The black and crimson spider, its fangs dripping a dark poison, uses the two arms beside its fangs to pull a corpse from its tainted web.

Deathweavers are spiders who were once subjected to dark rituals and are now infused with necrotic energies. Their carapaces are mottled patterns of black, crimson, and ivory, and two arms flank their fangs.
**_Allied Evil_**. Deathweavers are often found in league with other intelligent, evil creatures. A powerful necromancer or an evil cult might ally with one, using the undead it spawns to bolster their strength in exchange for treasure or favors.

**_Web Spawn_**. The deathweaver's webs infuse corpses left in them with necrotic energy. A humanoid corpse cocooned in the webbing for 24 hours has a 50 percent chance of rising as a [[web zombie]] under its control. These zombies are shriveled and covered in tattered webbing.
