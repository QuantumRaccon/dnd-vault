## Description
---
Baphomet: Demon Lord of Minotaurs and the Prince of Beasts. Worshipped by the beastial minotaurs, the ogres, and the giants. Baphomet commands an army of demonic minions from his Endless Maze within the 600th Layer of the Abyss. Three of these have served different purposes to Baphomet in his endless wars and each with their own unique abilities and characteristics.

With a blood-curdling howl of glee, an eight foot tall, goat-headed demon charges into battle with an oversized longspear, ravaging those that fall under its charge. The fiends eyes are rheumy and whirl in their sockets, desperately searching for their next fight.

**_Corrupted Corpses_**. Bulezau are created from the corpses of women who died valiantly serving good deities. Their bodies are exhumed from the grave, subjected to dark rituals by Baphomet's cults and transformed into bloodthirsty, goat-headed demons to serve as shock troops for cults and demon lords across the planes.
**_Vicious Opportunists_**. All demons show relentless ferocity, but few rival the focussed brutality of a bulezau. These beasts delight in running down opponents, then goring them with their twisting horns. If a foe of a troop of bulezau falls prone, the whole pack will dive on the victim, tearing it to pieces. Even as a bulezau takes punishment in combat, it becomes more and more ferocious.
