**_Epitomes of Destruction_**. The noth-norren is one of the most destructive and malicious of all elemental creatures and joyfully indulges in the rampant destruction of anything it can fit into its churning vortex. Noth-norrens are typically found in the wildest regions of the Elemental Plane of Air, where their presence often goes overlooked until they strike. They are rare on the Material Plane, though they can be summoned by [[flying polyp \|flying polyps]] (Creature Codex) via an ancient ritual.

**_Strange Relations_**. Noth-norrens have a strange connection to [[flying polyp \|flying polyps]] (Creature Codex), and, when the two creatures are found together, they cooperate in battle. Sages have long speculated about the relationship between the two creatures, some believing that noth-norrens were created by flying polyps for use in their ancient wars, while others maintain that nothnorrens are flying polyps that have been slain and reborn on the elemental planes in new bodies.
