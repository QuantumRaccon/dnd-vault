## Description
---
>A tall, ape-like creature walks upright, its arms ending in heavy fists. The creature's lips curl back, revealing long, pointed teeth set in a powerful jaw.

Sasquatches are large beasts that stalk deep forests and other densely wooded areas. They are bipedal primates that stand about nine feet tall and are covered in black, brown, or red fur.
**_Famously Elusive_**. Many people claim to have seen a sasquatch, but almost none have proof of their interaction with the beast, creating questions about the creature's existence. Skeptics claim sasquatch sightings are simply misidentified bears, apes, or similar creatures. Many sages and hunters journey deep into forests, hoping to find proof sasquatches exist and returning only with a handful of fur that could belong to almost any animal.
In truth sasquatches are solitary nocturnal creatures that generally avoid confrontation. They prefer to stay in the shadows of the forest, dining on vegetation and insects while staying clear of other creatures.

**_Aggressive When Provoked_**. Though sasquatches prefer to avoid confrontation, they fight savagely when cornered or if another creature threatens their home or food source. Their powerful fists and teeth make formidable weapons. Sasquatches do not hesitate to initiate a conflict when threatened.

**_Attracted and Soothed by Music_**. There are some who claim sasquatches are drawn and calmed by music, particularly songs with a lullaby-like quality. These tales come with a warning: stopping the song before the sasquatch is lulled to sleep by its melody causes the beast to go into a violent rage.
