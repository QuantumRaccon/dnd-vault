## Description
---
_A wasp-like humanoid flits on humming wings. Its carapace gleams with bright jewel tones, flashing brilliantly in the light._

In tosculi hive cities, powerful queens reign supreme, but even they have difficulty managing an entire swarm on their own. To extend their reach and authority, they rely on jeweled drones. More intelligent than most other tosculi, jeweled drones oversee individual aspects of the swarm and hive, managing the efficient order that constrains tosculi life. The jeweled drones produce powerful pheromones that help extend their authority and that also serve to forge nearby tosculi into a precise and deadly fighting force.

**_Queen's Attendants_**. Jeweled drones are closest to the hive queens in both authority and physical proximity. They serve as advisors to the queen, bringing her news and information from all corners of the hive. It's not uncommon for queens to choose consorts from among the ranks of jeweled drones as well. Such favored wasp folk enjoy unparalleled influence, until the queen tires of and devours them
