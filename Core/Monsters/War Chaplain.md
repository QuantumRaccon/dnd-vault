## Description
---
The proud clergy of the god of honor and war, war chaplains promote and revere feats of bravery and sacrifice, committing such acts themselves. Warriors and soldiers seek their blessings before battle, and mercenaries ask their guidance in selecting a potential employer. War chaplains are always willing to provide this blessing and to advise mercenaries. They are often quite canny in knowing how a particular battle is likely to proceed, not always through divine knowledge or visions but simply through long experience and a sense of an army's potential and morale. The most capable war chaplains are often invited to ride with the officers or dine with generals, though they stand slightly outside the chain of commandâ€”they serve their god first.

War chaplains are both quite aggressive in battle and aware of the boundaries between war and its victims. While most of their ministry is devoted to counseling soldiers and officers, ruling on cases of plunder, or enforcing discipline in the ranks, they find time to comfort citizens, children, widows, and others in the wake of war. The glories of combat do not blind them to their duties under the laws of war. War chaplains are also necessarily well-versed in a broad range of funeral rites and practices, for their faithful soldiers often follow more than one tradition.
