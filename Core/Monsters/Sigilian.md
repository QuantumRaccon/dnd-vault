## Description
---
_Students of magic scoff at the idea of sigilians. Living spells fleeing their tomes? Ridiculous. More likely a hazing ritual to frighten new students._

**_Born of Ink and Page_**. More experienced mages know sigilians are no prank. Whether intentionally created or born from improperly transcribed spells, they exist. They commonly appear as swirling clouds of glowing runes. 

**_Hunger for Knowledge_**. Sigilians live unseen in libraries, arcing between books, eating words, and leaving behind scrambled passages. They're most dangerous when they enter spellbooks, where they can eat inscribed spells. 

**_Sticks and Stones_**.  Undisturbed sigilians are docile, but the destructive nature of their hunger makes it impossible for librarians and wizards to live and let live. Left alone, they can become powerful, self-aware, intelligent sigilians that store most of the words that form them in heavy tomes similar to a lich's phylactery. 

**_Construct Nature_**.  A sigilian doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
