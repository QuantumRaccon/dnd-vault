## Description
---
_These powerful horses have eight legs and variously snowy, dappled grey, or rich black coloration. Evil and cowardice are anathema to the sleipnir, and those adventurers who seek to ride them must first impress them with brave deeds and heroic songs._

**_Epic Origins_**. The sleipnir are touched by divinity, their speed and strength the stuff of legends. They appear when great acts of courage are about to be undertaken, and they may offer temporary service in this case, acting as mounts or beasts of burden. They hauled the raw timber for the first walls of Valhalla, carried queens into war against Jotunheim, and pulled the sun to Niflheim for the lost to be found.

**_Draugr Bane_**. Sleipnir loathe the dishonorable undead and pursue them determinedly across the steppes and snowfields. Their hooves have a brilliant sheen, flashing with ensorcelling runes whenever they strike the undead. The great sleipnir matriarch, Gullfaxi, is famous for trampling an ancient vampire to death as the monster fled across an ice field.
