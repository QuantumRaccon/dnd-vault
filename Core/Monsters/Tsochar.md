## Description
---
Parasitic infiltrators from a cold and distant world, the tsochari seek to steal the bodies of the wealthy and influential to further their nefarious goals.
**_Wearers of Flesh_**. A tsochar resembles a tangled mess of knotted ropes or a ball of barbed wire. It has dozens of thin but strong tentacles, each studded with small, sharp, sicklelike claws. Its body is little more than a thickening and joining of its multiple limbs.
A tsochar can bore its way into a helpless living creature's body, slipping its ropy tendrils into the spaces between organs and muscles and disappearing into the victim's cavities. The tsochar can inhabit this host for years, parasitically feeding on the host's body and nervous system while manipulating it as a living puppet, even against its will. If the host provides too much resistance, the tsochar can bore out the host's nervous system, killing it and replacing the host entirely. This is often the tsochar's last effort, as the body without fail begins to wither and die shortly thereafter.

**_Appetite for Power_**. The tsochari crave power in all its forms, but hold arcane might in especially high regard. They eagerly seek out humanoid wizards to replace so they can steal away our world's arcane secrets. In order to achieve this goal, a small number of tsochari might infiltrate a church, university, or even a nation, inhabiting as much of the leadership as possible to seize a faction to further their efforts. Complex, grand schemes are not outside the scope of tsochari ambition.
The ultimate goals of the tsochari are mysterious. It seems that they seek some deep arcane magic, but its purpose is largely unknown.

**_Invaders from Another World_**. The tsochari hail from a world distant in space, a cold and lightless place so remote that the sun is little more than a bright star in a black sky. Long ago, powerful arcanists built gates linking certain terrible ruins in the normal world with the horrible world of the tsochari. Through these ancient gates, the tsochari steal into the world to roam human lands and infiltrate human society.

**_The Nine-Tongued Worm_**. Tsochari revere a sinister Elder Evil, Mak Thuum Ngatha, the Nine-Tongued Worm, which represents infinite knowledge and the destruction of barriers. Unlike many of the terrible and powerful Great Old Ones that dwell in the mindless chaos of the Far Realm, Mak Thuum Ngatha is interested in the Material Plane. Tsochari pay the Nine-Tongued Worm homage, but it has few worshipers among other races; only a handful of alienists and cultists even know of its existence. No being outside the Far Realm can say what the Nine-Tongued Worm's desires or goals might be, but they are certainly inimical to every living creature on the Material Plane.
