## Description
---
_An umbral vampire is a fiendish creature, once human but twisted into a dark reflection by an ancient curse. It resembles a deathly pale, gaunt human with stringy hair, dressed in scant rags. Misty strands of darkness leak from its empty eye sockets, yawning nasal cavity, and mouth._

**_Cursed Origin_**. Legends speak of an ancient city whose origins are lost to the ages, where a cabal of wizards with the power to manipulate the flow of time made its citizens immortal. When the wizards fell and no longer held back the ravages of time, the citizens aged centuries in moments. Instead of dying, the wretches lingered on in their dark realm.

**_Bound to Darkness_**. All umbral vampires originate in the City Fallen into Shadow, and under most circumstances, they're encountered only in that forsaken place. Despite the terrors it holds, adventurers continue to seek out the city, chasing legends of potent artifacts and boundless treasure accumulated during its golden age. Occasionally, an umbral vampire slips into the mortal world, where it hides in a place seldom or never touched by sunlight and emerges at night to search for victims.

**_Shadowy Nature_**. An umbral vampire doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
