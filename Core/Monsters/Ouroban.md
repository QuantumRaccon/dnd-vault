## Description
---
_Blood and slaughter are meat and drink to the ouroban! Strike hard, they say, to hasten the apocalypseâ€”death in the name of the great wyrm!_

**_Bringers of Apocalypse_**. Fanatical warriors obsessed with apocalypse and the power they believe will come to them when it arrives, ourobans spread fear, slaughter, and chaos wherever they can. In the doom cults to which they belong, no creature of greater rank rests easy with an ouroban underling as ourobans either claw their way to the top or die in the attempt. Those beneath an ouroban, however, rest a bit easier, so long as they display steady devotion in stoking the ouroban's vanity.


> [!INFO] Ouruban in Midgard
>Venerating a dark, malevolent interpretation of Ouroboros, a number of ourobans joined the ranks of the Doomspeaker cult. Though the cult's disparate cells mainly worship demons, displays of destructive will and power sways them quickly, and ouroborans do not hesitate to take advantage of this. As a result, the ourobans often claim a following of doomspeaker cultists, be they human, dragonborn, kobold, or otherwise. A wise ouroban usually counts a debased cleric or two in its retinue.
