**_Druid Servants_**. Vine golems are constructs created by druids for use as scouts and guardians. These plant-like constructs maintain a psychic connection with their creators, who can see through their eyes and cast spells through them. The golem-creator connection is maintained across the planes of the multiverse and is severed only if the construct or the druid dies. The vine golem is made from a variety of rare plants and flowers found only in the depths of old-growth forests. The process of creating a vine golem is closely guarded by cabals of druids, who will sometimes gift worthy druids with the knowledge in the form of a [[manual of golems \|manual of vine golems]].

**_Golems without Creators_**. When a vine golem's creator dies, the construct carries out the druid's final orders and then retreats to the nearest wilderness. Driven by a psyche fractured from the loss of its creator, the vine golem guards the animals and plants of its chosen home with extreme prejudice, attacking all intruders, regardless of any previous affiliation they might have had with its creator.

**_Construct Nature_**. A vine golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
