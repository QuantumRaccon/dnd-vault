**_Parasitic_**. Brain hoods are parasites that are rarely encountered without host animals. In fact, outside of its host, a brain hood poses little danger to intelligent creatures or creatures who are not beasts. Brain hoods prefer to bond with larger creatures, such as bears or dire wolves, due to the beasts' impressive physical prowess. They use the animals as powerful physical vessels, helping the host creature find food but otherwise subjugating the dim intelligence within it.

**_Calculating_**. The brain hood is inherently evil and despises all living things that possess bodies of their own. They delight in using their beast forms to attack and kill humanoids, particularly if the humanoids are smaller or less powerful than their bonded beast.

**_Druidic Enemies_**. Given the unique nature of a brain hood's existence, some people mistake them for druids in beast form. Brain hoods often encourage this belief, sowing mistrust and discord between villagers and a local circle of druids. This practice, coupled with the brain hood's abominable treatment of beasts, drives druids to hunt down and destroy brain hoods. Traveling druids listen for stories of sudden, uncommonly aggressive animal attacks, knowing the cause could be a sign that a brain hood is in the area.
