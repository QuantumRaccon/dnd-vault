## Description
---
_With a fondness for cracking open ribcages and pulling out beating hearts, Black Sun priestesses are always on the lookout for the next sacrifice to their blasphemous gods._

With her devotion painted in blood across her breast and her eyes alight with fervor for her dark faith, the Black Sun priestess embraces her cruel duties with relish.

**_Front Line Fighter_**. Urging her people on to night raids for slaughter and glory, she wades into the fray alongside them as they leave little more than cracked, burnt bones in their wake. With her greatclub flecked with dried blood and her face painted white as a skull, she cuts a fearsome figure for a fearsome faith.
