## Description
---
>A jagged shard of smoky translucent crystal, approximately the size and mass of a housecat, hovers silently across the field.

**_Strange Families_**. Grimmlets reproduce by creating near clones of themselves when injured by arcane energy, leading them to quickly gather in large familial [[grimmlet swarm \|swarms]]. Strangely, a grimmlet can only swarm with other grimmlets created from the same progenitor grimmlet, which leads the swarm. Not long after the swarm forms, it disperses, each grimmlet moving on to create new swarms through magic injury.

**_Whispering Menace_**. Grimmlets do not speak. In fact, they never communicate with other creatures via any known form of language or telepathy, though they do seem to understand creatures of the Void. Despite this, the air around a grimmlet mutters and whispers at all times in a foul-sounding invocation. When the creature uses its innate magic, these whispers rise in volume slightly, giving canny listeners a split-second warning that something, likely unpleasant, is about to occur.


> [!INFO] Grimmlets in Midgard
>Grimmlets arrive in the mortal realm from the same portion of the Void that spawned the Waste Walker Kb'r'ck of Crystal. Grimmlets were named in honor of the unfortunate tracker who discovered them, Aleksei Grimmczyk. Aleksei did not survive this initial meeting, but his demise was recounted by his friend, the elfmarked mage Alethrie.
