## Description
---
Bloated ghouls are ghouls who have engaged in ritual gorging on the flesh of hundreds of humanoids, their bodies swelling with undigested meat and bone. They eventually become pot-bellied undead maddened with hunger. A bloated ghoul's home is often slick with spilled blood and guts, which it happily licks off the floor and walls.
**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The ghoul doesn't require air or sleep.
