## Description
---
_The skin of this large snake is covered in an elegant pattern of intricate markings that scintillate with an eerie, supernatural brilliance. Its scales undulate a mesmerizing glamour as it slowly slithers forward._

**_Hypnotic Serpents_**. The scitalis is a deadly serpentine monstrosity that stuns its prey with the marvelous glimmer of its magically-variegated skin. Unlike most ophidians, these venomous hunters move rather slowly and rely on the stupefying effects of their otherworldly scales to capture the fleet of foot. With its prey adequately disabled, the scitalis languidly closes in to feast.

**_Warm-bodied Wyrms_**. Due to the strange quality of its iridescent skin, the scitalis is actually a warm-blooded reptile. This torpid supernatural monstrosity is cold-resistant and can be seen wandering as far as the frigid climes of the arctic. The snakeskin of the scitalis maintains some of its enchanted properties once shed and can often fetch handsome rewards from purveyors of the arcane.

**_Eldritch Origins_**. The provenance of the scitalis is a mystery as stupefying as its gleaming scales. Some sages speculate a draconic pedigree, while others claim this beautiful but deadly ophidian is a true child of Yig, the blasphemous Father of Serpents. Scitalis sightings are infrequent enough to fuel speculative and disquieting reports of variant breedsâ€”glittering serpents with sinister spines, bat-like wings, or several sharp-toothed heads.
