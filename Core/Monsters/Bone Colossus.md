## Description
---
In his tome of deranged ramblings, Tomislav the Thrice-Flaye theorized how "posthumes"2014the tiny skeletal creatures used to make up the bone collectivesâ€”might be gathered in even greater numbers to form bigger, stronger creatures. Thus was born the bone colossus, an undead creature big and powerful enough to serve as a rallying point for undead legions in battle.
> [!INFO] Bone Colossi in Midgard
>The first bone colossus was deployed in anger against the Electoral Kingdom of Krakova, where it proved decisive in bringing the siege of Wallenbirg to a rapid and favorable conclusion for the undead armies. More bone colossi are under construction; an enthusiastic Emperor Nicoforus intends to position the huge creatures at the vanguard of each of his imperial legions.


**_Necrotech_**. Necromancers, both living and dead, sometimes come together to make massive undead creatures known collectively as "necrotech". In nations ruled by undead, these massive creations often act as siege weapons or powerful modes of transportation.
> [!INFO] Necrotech in Midgard
>The darakhul of the Ghoul Imperium have long practiced necromancy, using the corpses and bones of Underworld denizens to create new undead servants and devise powerful war machines to aid in their conquest of the subterranean lands. Under Emperor Nicoforus, the darakhul necromancers, known as the Necrophagi, have prospered in their mission to develop experimental necrotech, and their progress has accelerated over the last decade, thanks to the blasphemous volumes of eldritch lore gifted to the ghouls by the vampires of Morgau and Doresh in exchange for their military aid against Krakova.
