## Description
---
_A bit of catchy, repetitive music emanates from nowhere, drifting and moving as if dancing in the empty air._

**_Born from Drama_**. Incredibly moving arias, passionate performances, and ditties that drive you mad are often the product of ostinatos. These creatures of living music are born from overwrought emotions, and they feed off the vitality and personality of mortals.

**_Song Searchers_**. Ostinatos wander the mortal world as repetitive snippets of song, searching for hosts and rich feeding grounds. They enter hosts secretly, remaining undetected to prolong their voracious feasting as long as possible.
