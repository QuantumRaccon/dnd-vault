## Description
---
Arachtus are unintelligent, ambulatory carnivorous plants that look like giant spiders formed out of multiple cacti. They are found in arid desert regions where they exist to do little more than hunt and feed.

**_A Prickly Bunch_**. Though unintelligent, arachtus are intensely territorial and seek out territory with a ready source of water - be it an oasis, a spring, or some other source. As well as providing the small amount of water they need to survive, these sites also serve to attract prey. Arachtus are indiscriminate about what they attack; if a creature is smaller than the arachtus and in its territory, then it is dinner.
**_Natural Camoflage_**. Because the arachtus is a plant, when it is at rest, it is nearly unregonizable until potential prey stumbles into its domain, whereupon the monster springs into action and attacks. Many an unwary traveler has met their doom while cutting open an arachtus to extract water from the seemingly benign cactus.
