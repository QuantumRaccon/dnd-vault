## Description
---
_From the fog, a monstrous form emerges. Its initial resemblance to an upright toad is quickly dispelled, as it reaches out with masses of long, writhing tentacles. Six eyes glow balefully above its massive fissure of a mouth._

Shaped like a bipedal frog or toad, its arms are stumps that end in a mass of long, writhing tentacles. Three yellow eyes adorn either side of the yann-an-oed's head, and its mouth is a massive fissure.

**_Dimensional Drifters_**. Found in oceans across multiple dimensions, many believe the spores of the yann-an-oed drift through the spaces between realities until they find a world that has adequate water and prey.
