## Description

>The tiger rises from its slumber, stretching its draconic wings. Light glints off its backswept horns as it roars its deafening challenge at intruders.

**_Treasure Hoard_**. Similar to other dragons, felid dragons are treasure hoarders with an eye for shiny and sparkly things. They sometimes align themselves with those who are trying to do good in the world, though their motivation is typically selfish and focused on obtaining treasure.

**_Curious and Playful_**. Like most cats, felid dragons are naturally curious and often put themselves in danger just to learn more about the world. They like to play with their prey, allowing it to live a little longer than necessary before knocking it down again for their own entertainment. This behavior is unavoidably instinctual and even the most austere felid dragons succumb to it.
