## Description
---
 Pious servants of the sun god, dwarven graveslayers belong to an elite group of undead-slaying warriors. Trained and drilled from an early age in the art of battle, these dwarves are molded into fanatical fighters against the skeletons, zombies, and worse creatures that threaten their mountain homeland. Although not full paladins, the graveslayers have blessings from the sun god that grant them the ability to channel holy power through their weapons and ensure that the undead they slay do not rise up again. The bodies of any fallen comrades are carried back home whenever possible to ensure they do not line up against the dwarves as undead opponents in the future. 

> [!INFO] Graveslayers in Midgard
>The graveslayers are active in the Black Canton of Grisal in the Ironcrags bordering the Grisal Marches of western Doresh. The dwarves battle the skeletons and zombies of Morgau, raiding across the river into the mountains and beyond to the infamous Zombie Wood. A few members of this tradition also operate out of the Wolfmark, fighting against the Morgau undead with allies from the Northlands. Graveslayers who fall in battle and are left behind often become [[ghost dwarf \|ghost dwarves]] if Morgau's necromancers don't get to them first.


The necromancers of the Blood Kingdom regularly animate the corpses of dwarven raiders as zombies. When a graveslayer's body is available, they use dark rituals to corrupt its soul, enlisting it to fight against its former comrades. A corrupted graveslayers' type changes from humanoid to undead, and it inflicts extra necrotic (rather than radiant) damage with its battleaxe. It loses the ability to turn undead.
