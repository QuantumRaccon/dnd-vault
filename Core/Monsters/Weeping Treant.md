## Description
---
_This twisted tree's face is made of cracked, black bark knotted into vaguely humanoid features, and thick tears of sap run down its face._

Weeping treants clearly are related to other treants, but they are smaller than the normal variety, little more than 30 feet tall with a trunk 3 feet in diameter, and weighing no more than 4,500 lb. Their gnarled trunks are often twisted, and their wood often groans when they move.

**_Forest Wardens_**. Weeping treants are protectors of dark, shadowy forests, and they are as long-lived as the trees themselves. They act as guardians for an entire forest or for something specific within the forestâ€”they have no pity for those carrying axes or fire.

**_Skeptical Mein_**. Weeping treants are terrifying and relentless when fighting in defense of their charge. They are inherently distrustful, particularly of anything not of the natural or shadow world, and they're notoriously difficult to fool or deceive.

**_Enchanted Bitter Tears_**. Sages and scholars debate why these creatures weep, but no one has come forward with a compelling reason beyond "it's what trees do." The weeping treants themselves refuse to speak on the matter. Their tears are occasionally components in druidic spells or items.
