## Description
---
_An otherworldly humanoid of such indescribable beauty, it pains anyone's eyes to gaze upon her._

**_Beauty that Destroys_**. An abominable beauty is so perfect that her gaze blinds, her voice is so melodious that no ears can withstand it, and her touch is so tantalizing that it burns like fire. In adolescence, this fey creature adopts features that meet the superficial ideals of the nearest humanoid population: long.legged elegance near elves, a stout figure with lustrous hair near dwarves, unscarred or emerald skin near goblins.

**_Jealous and Cruel_**. Abominable beauties are so consumed with being the most beautiful creature in the region that they almost invariably grow jealous and paranoid about potential rivals. Because such an abominable beauty cannot abide competition, she seeks to kill anyone whose beauty is compared to her own.

**_Male of the Species_**. Male abominable beauties are rare but even more jealous in their rages.
