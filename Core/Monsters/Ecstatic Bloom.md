## Description
---
{A single enormous white flower blooms at the heart of the lustrating grove. Many religions build temples around these great manifestations of divinity because of their curative dew. The blooms are highly intelligent and shimmer when conversing with other creatures. The stalks of the blooms are thick and recover from injury quickly.}

**_Heart of the Grove_**. An ecstatic bloom is the leader and ultimate expression of a lustrating grove. A bloom will only appear if at least three hallowed reeds and two alabaster trees grow nearby. The perfume of the bloom calms beasts and repels undead.

**_Philosopher Flowers_**. Ecstatic blooms are highly intelligent, thoughtful creatures. They enjoy communicating with other life forms and are excellent judges of character and motivation. They prefer to discuss the nature of divine power and the origins of the celestials. They love their grove-mates and consider the hallowed reeds and alabaster trees within their grove to be their children.
