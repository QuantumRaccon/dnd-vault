## Description
---
>This creature looks much like a human-sized scorpion with wide, laced wings. The tip of its curled tail holds numerous barbs that drip sticky poison.

**_Chemical Killing Machine_**. The kezai is a creature that lives in hot climates and wages a chemical war on anything that opposes it. It emits a foul poison from its tail, coating the barbs that it hurls at enemies. If this wasn't deadly enough, it naturally produces a thin, flammable gas that it can ignite with a searing chemical produced in a gland near its mandibles. Fortunately for those who come across the kezai, the gland is slow-acting and takes time to produce the chemical necessary to ignite the gas.
