## Description
---
_These tiny, obsidian-skinned, bat-winged fey always have a hungry look, leering with razor-sharp fangs showing and licking their leathery faces with their forked, purple tongues._

**_Hidden in Crevices_**. Buccas are tiny, underground faeries who are also known as "snatchers," because they love to steal from miners and hoard precious minerals and gems in tiny, trap.filled crevices. Their small size makes them easy to overlook.

**_Treasure Finders_**. Buccas are often enslaved by derro as treasure seekers and can be summoned by some derro shamans. Buccas are the bane of the dwarves of many mountains and hilly cantons, serving as spies and scouts for evil humanoids.

**_Bat Friends_**. Buccas often train bats as mounts, messengers, and guard animals. On occasion they sell them to goblins and kobolds.
