## Description
---
_Suddenly, a pair of emaciated humanoids with greenish, rubbery hides, wicked looking claws, and enlarged lower jaws burst out of the side of the air pocket._

**_Demon Friends_**. Marine cousins of trolls, scrags as a group are very much attuned to water, water-based creatures, and water demons, going so far as to speak their languages and ally with forces of elemental water, ice, and ocean depths.

**_Net Stealers and Shipbreakers_**. Both lesser and greater scrags are notorious for pulling down fishing nets from under the water, then either devouring the fisherfolk who hold onto them or eating the catch out of a full net (abandoning the ripped nets afterwards). In groups led by a greater scrag, they often stave in a small ship's hull, sink it, and devour the crew.
