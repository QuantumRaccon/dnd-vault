## Description
---
_A lithe being of dark beauty appears human, though its movements, intensity, and charm are so powerful and coordinated it seems almost supernatural._

Dhampirs are the half-living children of vampires and living mothers, born into a world that fears and rejects them. Thanks to their human-like appearance, many dhampirs hide in plain sight, spending their lives concealing their identities.

**_Blood Ties_**. For most dhampirs, their mother's family is all they have since even those who do not know of a dhampir's true nature are generally put off by their supernatural presence. As a result, families with a dhampir withdraw from the world, becoming reclusive. Most dhampirs strike out on their own when they mature to spare their families further burden, but the half-living remember what their loved ones sacrificed. Dhampirs will return to aid their families at a moment's notice.
