## Description
---
_A hulking construct of living weaponry shambles across the battlefield, punching a hole through the vanguard like a torrent of steel._

These animated piles of weapons and armor can shore up the defenses of a beleaguered line of troops or serve as the point of attack against entrenched enemies.

**_Wartime Wizard Ingenuity_**. Conjuration magic capable of raising the contents of an unattended weapons armory was born out of necessity during long sieges. War arcanists would find themselves defending locations that had exhausted their troops, leaving the arcanists with plenty of armaments and no one to wield them. Thus was born the armory golem.


**_Walking Weapons_**. Armory golems resemble a pile of discarded swords, shields, and spears in a vaguelyâ€‘humanoid shape. Because they are literal moving armories, these golems have many weapons at their disposal. Soldiers have been known to resupply from an armory golem during battle.


**_Focus Weapon_**. The armory golem's creation spell requires one weapon or piece of armor as the target of the magic. This item powers the rest of the golem and is located in the center of its body. Casters have conjured more powerful golems using enchanted weapons as the focus, and some have even created sentient armory golems by employing sentient magic items, though how the items feel about such employment varies.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
