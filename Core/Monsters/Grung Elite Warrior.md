## Description
---


A creature [[poisoned]] by a grung can suffer an additional effect that depends on the grung's color, as described below. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer [[poisoned]] by the grung.

**_Blue Grung_**. The [[poisoned]] creature must make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn.
**_Gold Grung_**. The creature is [[charmed]] by the grung and can speak Grung.
**_Green Grung_**. The [[poisoned]] creature can't move except to climb or make standing jumps. If the creature is flying, it can't take any actions or reactions unless it lands.
**_Orange Grung_**. The [[poisoned]] creature is [[frightened]] of its allies.
**_Purple Grung_**. The [[poisoned]] creature feels a desperate need to soak itself in liquid or mud. It can't take actions or move except to do so or to reach a body of liquid or mud.
**_Red Grung_**. The [[poisoned]] creature must use its action to eat if food is within reach.
