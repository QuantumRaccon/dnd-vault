## Description
---
The Emerald Order cult leader has embraced the mysteries of the Emerald Tablet and has bent his worship of Thoth-Hermes to furthering the efforts of the Order. He seeks to gather arcane and alchemical knowledge wherever it is found by any means necessary. If subtle manipulations fail, he is not above using lethal methods to ensure the cult's goals are met.
