## Description
---
_Although it has the head of a shaggy bear, this humanoid creature wears armor and carries a battleaxe in one massive, clawed hand and a warhammer in the other. It's a solid slab of muscle that towers imposingly over most humans._

The hulking bearfolk are intimidating creatures. Brutish and powerful, they combine features of humanoid beings and bears. Their heads are ursine with heavy jaws and sharp teeth. Dark fur covers their bodies, which are packed with muscle. Adult bearfolk stand at least 7 feet tall and weigh more than 600 pounds.

**_Sworn to the Bear King_**. Bearfolk are almost universally the subjects of the Bear King, one of the great fey lords. The bearfolk protect the cities of their northern kingdom and roam the wooded roads of the wilderness. The greatest number of bearfolk are concentrated around the court of the Bear King himself, with ancient bear jarls governing their unruly kin. Only a handful of renegades, exiles, and other rogue bearfolk live permanently outside this society.

**_Passionate and Volatile_**. Boisterous and jovial, the bearfolk are a people of extremes. They celebrate with great passion and are quick to explosive anger. Settling differences with wrestling matches that leave permanent scars is common, as is seeing two bloodied bearfolk sharing a cask of mead and a raucous song after such a scuffle.
