## Description
---
_Shadows weave around a lithe dancing figure, making it difficult to look away. The face of the dancer changes from beautiful to hideous, but always fascinating._

**_Servants of the Queen_**. Pattern dancers train in the arts of deception, magic, combat, and performance, always for a singular purpose: to serve their fey liege, the Queen of Night and Magic (Tome of Beasts, p. 192). The most promising young shadow fey of any gender are taken from their parents at a young age to train. Many fail to meet the rigorous standards, but a few thrive. After years of training and conditioning, they are divided into troupes and begin their lives as pattern dancers.


**_Entertainer Spies_**. Pattern dancer troupes, consisting of anywhere from 3â€“12 dancers plus retainers and bodyguards for larger troupes, leave the Shadow Realm on missions for their queen and spend most of their time in the mortal world. With their reputations already established by their predecessors, troupes are always in demand by the rich, famous, and powerful.


**_Spies for Hire_**. While they are ultimately in the service of their queen, pattern dancers also frequently offer their spying services and information gathering skills to the highest bidder. Their payment, however, is often in memories or in other information that they can pass along or provide to their liege.
