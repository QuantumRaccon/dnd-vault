## Description
---
>The humanoid's piercing blue eyes lock on their target as it charges forward with bloodlust. Bloodcurdling battle cries and flying spears follow the berserker's charge.

Regardless of what type of prior life they led, any humanoid can become one of [[Avatar of Boreas \|Boreas']] (Tome of Beasts) chosen. Some humanoids are born with runic symbols designating them as creatures blessed by the North Wind, but most must undergo several trials before the first wintry rune scrawls itself into their flesh. The trials include surviving the highest mountain peaks in the dead of winter, defeating a [[Frost Giant]] in single combat, and crafting a spear out of the fang or claw of an icy beast. Even then, Boreas may deny his favor.

**_Blood and Weapons of Ice_**. A humanoid chosen by Boreas goes through a transformation to become more like its patron. Its blood freezes into ice, and its weapons become forever rimed.

**_Blessed and Loyal_**. Humanoids chosen by Boreas further his goals, protect his holy sites, spread winter wherever they walk, and honor the North Wind with every fallen foe.
