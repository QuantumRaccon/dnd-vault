## Description
---
_Despite its size, the twisted and gnarled tree-man moves precisely and quietly. It cloaks itself in a cape of darkness with only its pale face visible, lit by blue flame eyes._

**_Damned Fey_**. Mandrianos are a perversion of treants grown from soil defiled by ritual sacrifice. Bound to shepherd the undead, they ceaselessly wander their territories, collecting and tending their mindless charges. Beneath their billowing cloaks, their bodies have the gray color of driftwood. A mandriano's cloak is stitched from leaves of darkness and blows apart as if struck by a gale when the mandriano dies.

**_Never Alone_**. Mandrianos work in pairs or small teams as they gather their flocks of undead and hunt for the living. They drain the essence of living creatures to feed themselves, their deceptively long arms allowing them to quickly snatch up prey.
