## Description
---
_The ground ripples and tears as rocks fall, jets of flame erupt, and howling winds rage around an elemental locus. The land is angry._

**_Spirit of the Land_**. Elemental loci are living spirits inhabiting or embodying tracts of land and geographical features. They are the ultimate personification of nature—the land itself come to life—varying in size from small hills to entire ridge lines, with no discernible pattern to where they take root. Stubborn Nature. Elemental loci are fiercely protective of their chosen location. They tolerate no interference in the natural order and challenge all who despoil the land, be they mortal, monster, or god.

> [!INFO] Elemental Loci in Midgard
>Among the Tamasheq, the elemental loci are cherished as minor deities, nearly as powerful as the Wind Lords themselves. The sorcerers of Kush have tried to capture and enslave loci for decades; thus far without success, but they grow bolder (and closer to their goal) with each attempt.
