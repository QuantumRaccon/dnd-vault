## Description
---
_Stepping through corners of otherwise solid walls, the hairless doglike creatures coated in blue ichor are relentless pursuers able to cross dimensional barriers in pursuit of prey._

**_Hunters from the Void_**. Hideous and strange creatures from the Void, hounds of Tindalos hunt those who travel the planes of existence or break the bonds of time. None know if the hounds take offense to travel through time and space or if there is some quality of such travelers that they find irresistible, but, once they have the scent of such a creature, they rarely lose it. They hunt without rest, draining the creature of all fluids with long, hollow tongues once caught, leaving behind little more than a husk. They possess intelligence and the ability to speak, but no society or civilization of their kind has ever been witnessed. They live only to hunt.


**_A Taste for Humanity_**. Hounds of Tindalos prefer human prey even when presented with other options.


**_Hideous Beasts_**. The hound resembles a hairless dog, but its forelimbs end in remarkably human-looking hands. It has the head of a bat with large, luminous eyes and a short black beak, sharp as a razor. Notches in the center of the top and bottom of the beak allow a long, blue, hollow proboscis to snake out for feeding. Its skin color varies, though nodules along the hound's spine ooze a blue ichor that coats it most of the time.
