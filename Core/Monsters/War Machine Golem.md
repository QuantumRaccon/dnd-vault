## Description
---
_A tavern-sized, iron construct crushes everything in its path, sweeping away enemies and walls with one swipe of its mighty fist. The top of its head sports a catapult launching boulders._

War machine golems are 40-foot-high, self-piloting siege weapons powered by dwarven engineering and necromancy.

**_Fueled by Dead Dwarves_**. It takes a battalion of dwarf engineers a decade to manufacture a body for a golem war machine. Once the body is constructed, a circle of five necromancers summons the spirits of the dwarves' ancestors. Infused with these spirits, the body comes to life. The construct is bound to a master by the circle of necromancers at the time of the spirit infusion, usually a dwarf general. If the golem loses its master, it follows its last order and then lies dormant until another circle of necromancers is assembled to cast a ritual to bind the construct to a new master.


**_Fueled by Dead Dwarves_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.




War machine golems can be built with alternate forms of ammunition for their catapults. When creating such a variant, substitute the appropriate damage for the appropriate damage type. For example, golems with ballistae on their heads deal piercing damage while those that sling flaming pitch deal fire damage. All other effects of the catapult attack remain the same.
