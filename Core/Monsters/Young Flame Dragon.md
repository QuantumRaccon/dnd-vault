## Description
---
_The dragon bears black scales, more charred than naturally colored. Cracks between the scales glow a dull red, until the dragon rears its head and roars. Red embers become bright orange flames as the creature lights up from tail to maw._

The flame dragons are capricious creatures, fascinated by dark emotions and destructive passions. The dragons of eternal fire are proud and jealous, quick to anger, and utterly unforgiving. They bring complete and total ruin to entire civilizations for trivial reasons, but their true motivation is the fun to be had. These burning serpents treat rage, deceit, and despair as toys for their amusement. "May you be the fire's plaything" is a curse often used by the foolish.

**_Taunting Others_**. The hot-blooded creatures tease their victims like cats, seeing the world and all within it as their rightful prey. Young flame dragons are less subtle than their elders. Wyrmlings may force a woman to watch her family die or ruin a beautiful face for pleasureâ€”direct and evil. As the dragon matures, this natural sadism develops into a desire for more complicated sport. Aging dragons of fire use politics, murder, and magic in elaborate schemes only their ilk can appreciate. Many create plots so intricate and layered that they lack a true resolution, creating only endless manipulation. A hero might foil an assassination only to see the king thus saved become a despot. She might defeat the vizier whispering lies in the ruler's ear only to discover he was a pawn in a vast conspiracy. Dark ambitions, poisoned daggers, and old vendettas build such momentum that one scheme begins each time another ends. Often, even killing the draconic mastermind cannot extinguish the fires it started.

**_Malevolent Purpose_**. The results of these schemes are secondary to the enjoyment they derive from pursuing a nebulous and everchanging goal. Some spend centuries torturing a family line for nothing more than trespassing on the dragon's land. Others plot eternal curses after twisting poorly chosen words into the most dire of insults. The vengeance itself is not as important as having an excuse to hate, plot, and ruin. Flame dragons relish such opportunities for revenge, seeing each as a delightful hobby. The disruption of a game kindles a true and terrible rage, and in these rare moments of defeat, their anger can be catastrophic. Entire cities burn.

**_Fond of Souvenirs_**. Flame dragons are as materialistic and territorial as other true dragons. Each pursues an individual obsession it fixates upon with mad devotion to fill its hoard. Some corrupt innocence, others push nations to war, but they always collect a memento for each victory, whether petty or grand. One might collect scorched skulls, while another saves the melted treasures of toppled empires. When not out sowing discord, the ancient flame dragons enjoy contemplating their hoards. Every piece reminds them of their own majesty and genius.
Nothing is safe from a flame dragon's endless scheming and narcissism. They crave absolute attention and constant reassurance. Anyone who humiliates a flame dragon would be wiser to kill it. Its survival ensures the dragon's undivided attention for generations. It would be wiser still to make certain there is not a trace of involvement in a flame dragon's death. All burning serpents see the murder of one of their kin as the gravest insult.

>Flame dragons descend from the passionate daughter of the great World Serpent. Bards say a new flame dragon egg appears in the world when Glaurvistus completes her cyclical games of lust and revenge. Her satisfaction brings ruin in the moment and for centuries to come when a new egg hatches.
>Glaurvistus, the Smoking Scourge, inserts herself into many mortal events, burning her mark upon history. She manufactures an outrage when bored, working wildly complex plots against arbitrary enemies until it all ends in death. Her favorite game involves pledging admiration for a stalwart hero and bringing slow but destructive ruin upon any force around that person. Her false affections culminate in a fiery death for the unfortunate object of her attentions. She always leaves some cherished possession untouched by the cremation and builds her hoards with the memories of a thousand murdered champions.
>Glaurvistus has many lairs, most within active volcanoes or deep below the ground. Each boasts unique treasures to lure would-be heroes. She grants many fortresses to her most beloved offspring, who oversee their mother's domain. There is no surer way for a hero to gain her attention than by slaying one of her favored children. Legends claim she lairs in a true sanctuary, accessing the outside world only through magic or caves of molten adamantine.
>The Smoking Scourge recognizes few rivals. She views most dragons as children and offers grudging esteem only to the oldest and most powerful. She greets her immediate siblings with familial respect but considers them all beneath her. From her spawn she demands obedience, and her regard is only earned with constant success. She expects immediate discarding of centuries-long plots at her merest whim, and the price for disloyalty is a terrible vengeance.
>The oldest of her children see patterns over centuries, and they wonder whether Glaurvistus pursues some greater goal they cannot fathom. All creation is her plaything.


**_Flame Dragon's Lair_**. Flame dragons dwell in lairs where a burning fire is always near: volcanoes, sulfur mines, caves full of geysers, and places where the Elemental Plane of Fire touches the Material Plane. Whatever the place, its purpose is always to serve as a showcase of all the trophies the dragon has collected. Carefully arranged and organized prizes decorate the walls, sometimes even protected behind crystal walls. This display both feeds the dragon's vanity and pride, and also serves as a lure to attract adventurers, since flame dragons love to encourage the lowest instincts in their prey.
Many of these lairs feature a huge, reflective surface. A flame dragon likes nothing more than itself.
