## Description
---
>This beautiful creature has a humanoid frame covered with tiny, colorful, chitinous plates, and it sports large, rounded red wings with dark markings. Its face is an odd combination of human and insectoid, with heavy brows and large antennae that protrude from its forehead. Menace lurks behind its red, baleful eyes, and the spikes that jut from its shoulders, elbows, and knees speak of danger.

Rhopalocerex, also known as the Purveyor of Deception and Master of Moths, is the father of [[death butterfly \|death butterflies]] (Tome of Beasts), moths, and all manner of other giant insects that are both beautiful and deadly. He lives in a layer of the Abyss that, like him, is beautiful at first sight, with vast vistas of flowers, trees, and a cloudless blue sky overhead; but it is equally deadly, with each element dripping with toxins, hiding some deadly surprise, or harboring hostile creatures. He lives at the top of a massive deciduous tree at the center of the plane. Thorny branches and leaves support the chambers of his stronghold above, while the bodies of his slain foes hang by nooses made of vines below.
**_Death Cloaked in Beauty_**. Rhopalocerex surrounds himself with things whose beauty is part of their deceptiveness and deadliness, including poisonous plants, colorful yet deadly creatures, weapons disguised as ornaments, and similar objects. He likes to draw potential victims in with their natural curiosity or admiration before exposing the true vileness within him. Despite this, he maintains an extensive collection of truly beautiful art gathered from numerous civilizations and races that he has destroyed throughout the multiverse. He prefers works of art that display technical complexity and mastery of the art form.

**_Master of Moths_**. Rhopalocerex is the lord of butterflies, moths, and other flying insects that take to the air under the cover of night and spread pestilence, poison, and filth. He is always followed by swarms of death butterflies, while other giant moths and butterflies cling to the walls and ceiling of his lair. The fluttering of their wings causes a constant pulsating sound to ripple through his lair. When he travels from his home plane, flying insects naturally flock to his location and follow him.

**_Cults of Rhopalocerex_**. Like Rhopalocerex himself, his cults' are obsessed with things that are both beautiful and deadly. When they perform ritual sacrifices in his name, they do so with expertly crafted blades and sweet-smelling but deadly poisons. The cult's leaders are almost always charismatic individuals with silver tongues or pleasing countenances. Skilled alchemists and poisoners are highly valued by the cult and many alchemists find themselves, sometimes unintentionally, in the employ of the cult.


**_Rhopalocerex's Lair_**. Rhopalocerex's lair is located in an impossibly massive tree deep in the Abyss. It is made of sticky strands like those used to construct a chrysalis, and access to the tree is via a massive spiral staircase winding through the tree's core. The tree houses a labyrinth of chambers filled with giant insects and their larvae and eggs.
