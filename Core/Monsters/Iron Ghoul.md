## Description
---
_A brutal and vicious-looking ghoul that carries a cruel glaive, its forearms up to its elbows are stained with dark, dried blood. Its glowing, rust-colored eyes penetrate with a calculating stare of restrained hunger._

**_Backbone of the Legions_**. Iron ghouls and ghasts are the elite members of the imperial legions, acting as non.commissioned officers, officers, and standard-bearers. They feed from the slave pits and march on the orders of the darakhul nobility.

**_Fond of Uniforms_**. Iron ghouls are proud of their status and uniforms. Their standard breastplates and open-faced helms are black iron with brass trim, and the helm's crest is often a ruby.dyed fan of bat wings or carrion beetle bristles to indicate their authority.

**_Tooth and Bone Weaponry_**. Many items of an iron ghoul's gear are decorated with inlaid bone or set with teeth, rather much as pearls might be used for weapons crafted elsewhere.
