## Description
---
_The terrible outline of something noxiously thin and bat-winged descends silently from above—a faceless black being with smooth, whale-like skin and horns that curve toward each other. Its barbed tail lashes needlessly as it clutches the air with ugly prehensile paws._

**_Silent Malevolence_**. Nightgaunts never speak or smile, having only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be. The beating of a nightgaunt's membranous wings makes no sound; nor does the tickling grasp of its cold, rubbery paws.

**_Nightmare Servitors_**. These mindless aberrations are creations of an elder god of the Great Abyss, who wages inter‑dimensional war with various gods and horrors of the Outer Void. Nightgaunts serve as the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls that inhabit the darkest corners of the Shadow Realm and realms of pure dream and fancy. On occasion, they ally themselves with humans and the forces of light against greater chaos and particularly hated demon lords. Such alliances last only so long as is necessary to restore the rule of law and burn out all corruption from a place. Once this is accomplished, they sometimes leave, satisfied in their work, and other times remain to attack the wounded forces of good.

**_Void Traveler_**. The nightgaunt doesn't require air, food, drink, or ambient pressure.
