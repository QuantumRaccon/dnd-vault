## Description
---
Many types of beetles inhabit the world, and, depending on the location and culture, they are used as food, companions, or beasts of burden by its people.
**_Arctic Beetles_**. Giant snow beetles are carrion-eating beetles that inhabit the coldest parts of the world. They collect snow into large balls for use against their enemies, for protection for their lairs, and to house their eggs. When food is abundant, they pack extra carrion into snowballs, saving the food for later or for feeding freshly hatched larvae. When attacked, giant snow beetles fling any snowballs on-hand that don't contain their young, often splattering attackers with frozen, rotten meat.
