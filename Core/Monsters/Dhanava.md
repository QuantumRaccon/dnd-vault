## Description
---
Dhanavas are created in the Nine Hells by taking the soul of a learned scholar and mixing it with that of a rakshasa. Some evil scholars and clerics undergo this ritual willingly to serve as spies for other rakshasas. Dhanavas are erudite and devious, and well versed in dark, arcane arts. They usually serve as advisors and strategists to other rakshasas in their shared pursuit of human flesh and worldly power. Dhanavas often bring rakshasas together by forming alliances between various rakshasas, who would otherwise work alone.

**_Disguised Manipulators_**. Dhanavas are able to alter their form at will, and are even more bloodthirsty than their rakshasa cohorts since they believe that humanoid flesh and blood increases their cognitive capacities. Moreover, these fiends consider it their sole purpose in life to acquire one or two rakshasa disciples and pass on all their knowledge to them, turning them into dhanavas as well.
**_Expert Negotiators_**. Dhanavas are known for their cunning and their affinity for playing politics, and steering others towards their own goals. They are often crucial in founding and managing small clans of rakshasas, using them to conquer whole cities and sometimes even entire kingdoms. They increase their arcane power by performing various elaborate rituals, feeding off the dark energy from the torture and suffering of humanoids.
**_Knowledge Seekers_**. A dhanavas' malleable form allows him or her to blend into most factions and among the citizenry of various kingdoms, allowing them access of huge amounts of information and the ability to be in the right place at the right time. Dhanavas usually have the creatures they intend to impersonate stalked and kidnapped, they then study their victims carefully while torturing them for their secrets. This helps them in their eternal quest for knowledge and helps them in their struggle for power.
