## Description
---
To the untrained eye, a Crocotta may look like a really large wolf or a weird bear. However, experienced adventurers will immediately notice that this beast is neither and far more dangerous. This large beast can change its colors in order to camouflage with the environment. It will lurk near farms and camps to try and listen to the names of its occupants. Then, the Crocotta will repeat a name in order to single out a person and lure it away. Only when the victim is far away from any help will the beast pounce on it, unceremoniously ripping it apart and eating.

**_Frightening Presence_**. Legends say that the Crocotta's howl and presence are so ghastly that even a veteran adventurer can be frozen in the spot, terrified.
**_Gleaming Eyes_**. A lesser-known fact about these beasts and the reason that their eyes are so big and shiny is that they are actually incredibly rare gems. Some even say putting one in your mouth will grant the person minor fortune-telling abilities.
