## Description
---
>A small bird with a fiery belly perches on the shoulder of the temple's acolyte, singing a divine song.

Avieres are fiery songbirds created by good deities and sent to holy sites on the Material Plane as protectors and teachers. They innately know the tenets of their deities and encourage those around them to uphold the tenets. They dislike leaving the area they were sent to tend, but they sometimes venture out to heal or evangelize passersby.
**_Songbirds_**. Locations containing avieres are always filled with beautiful music, as they sing the hymns of their deities at all hours of the day. In doing so, they heal and uplift their surroundings, leading to healthier flora and fauna and calmer weather in the area.

**_Temple Assistants_**. Avieres in temples spend most days aiding the temple's priests and priestesses, especially in coaching acolytes or those new to the faith. They take great pleasure in assisting scribes who are writing their deity's teachings, acting as a light source while singing the teachings to the scribes.


> [!INFO] Aviere Familiars
>Some aviere are willing to serve good-aligned spellcasters as a familiar. Such aviere have the following trait.
**_Familiar_**. The aviere can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the aviere senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the aviere is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the aviere's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the aviere can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
