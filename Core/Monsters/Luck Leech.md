## Description
---
>The elf-like creature rises, its bright green eyes flashing with menace. Short, impish horns peek out from its inky hair, and green smoke oozes out of the numerous circular mouths lining its arms.

When a humanoid who earned wealth through violence and duplicity gets lost in the Shadow Realm, its body becomes corrupted by the dark realm, turning it into a luck leech. These fey have arms covered in lamprey-like mouths that drain the luck out of their victims. They return to the Material Plane and stalk gambling houses and criminal underbellies for exceptionally lucky targets.
**_Amassing Fortune_**. Luck leeches obsess over gathering as much wealth and luck as possible, referring to both collectively as "fortune." They rarely notice and never care if their acquisition of fortune harms others.

**_Self-Serving_**. A luck leech cares first and foremost about itself. If it thinks its life is in danger, it expends any fortune it has to escape, knowing it can't enjoy its fortune if it's dead.


> [!INFO] Curse: Falling Fortunes
>A creature cursed with falling fortunes is plagued with bad luck for 24 hours. While cursed, the creature can't add its proficiency bonus to any attack rolls or ability checks. If the cursed creature rolls a 20 on an attack roll or an ability check, the curse ends. Alternatively, the curse can be lifted early by a [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.
