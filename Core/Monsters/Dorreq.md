## Description
---
_These twitching balls of tentacles surround an inhuman face dominated by a squid-like beak._

**_Servants of the Void_**. The dorreqi are servants to ancient horrors of the void and realms beyond human understanding. They are guardians and sentries for such creatures, and they swarm and attack any creatures approaching too close to the elder aberrations they serve.

**_Death from Above_**. Dorreq prefer to drop on their victims from above, pinning them in a grapple attack with their many tentacles and biting them with their large chitinous beaks.

> [!INFO] Dorreqi of the Wasted West
>Mages who study the Wasted West disagree whether the dorreqi are something that slipped through with the Great Old Ones during the Mage Wars, or if they are creatures twisted and warped by the alien radiations of the Walkers. Regardless, they are most commonly found swarming on and around the enormous Walkers of the Wastes, tootling strange, alien harmonies through their beaks.
