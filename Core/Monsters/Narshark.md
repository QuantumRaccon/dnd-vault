## Description
---
>Almost blending in with the sky, this creature looks like a large shark with cerulean-hued skin and incredibly long pectoral fins that it uses to sail through the air like a bird. Its mouth is filled with several rows of vicious teeth, and an ivory horn emerges from the top of its head.

**_Aerial Predators_**. A narshark is a creature that resembles a cross between a shark and a narwhal with dark blue skin, long serrated teeth, and a horn growing from its brow. Like many sharks, the narshark is a rapacious predator, hunting birds through the sky as a shark hunts fish. While it lacks the keen nose of most predators, the narshark has excellent eyesight and can pick out details at great distances. While narsharks are dangerous predators, they are seldom top of the aerial food chain and face fierce competition from [[giant eagle \|giant eagles]], [[hippogriff \|hippogriffs]], and [[harpy \|harpies]]. They are also frequently hunted by [[griffon \|griffins]], [[wyvern \|wyverns]], and [[roc \|rocs]] that easily pluck them out of the sky with their greater maneuverability and speed.

**_Magical Horns_**. The narshark gains its ability to fly from its magical horn. The horn can be severed from a living narshark, but doing so drives it into a panicked rage as it attempts to slay all those around it. Strangely, narsharks never use their horns in combat, possibly in fear of accidentally breaking them. A narshark's horn is commonly used in the creation of magic items that grant flight, and narsharks are often the target of hunters seeking to turn a profit.
