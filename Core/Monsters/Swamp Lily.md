## Description
---
>This large, delicate, orange flower stands guard over a sumptuous banquet laid out near its roots.

**_Deceivingly Delectable_**. Swamp lilies are carnivorous plants that thrive on the rotting remains of creatures they poison. While they can envenom victims with their tentacle-like roots, they prefer to lure in prey with an illusion of a seemingly benign feast. The lilies exude a scent of fruit with the musk from prey animals to complement the illusion. Their victims then peaceably eat the food, unwittingly ingesting the lily's roots and deadly toxin.

**_Wandering Menace_**. After killing enough prey to keep it well fed and provide nourishment for its seeds, it travels where it can sense creatures with a strong desire for food. Though the plant does not understand the dynamics of food supply, its ability to understand thoughts pertaining to food allows it to relocate where the inhabitants are desperate and more susceptible to its illusory feast.

**_Grove Guardians_**. Druids and creatures respectful of poisonous plants or resistant to the swamp lilies' illusions often establish a rapport with the lilies as protectors. Partners to the lilies give additional credence to the illusions produced by the plants and encourage unwanted guests to partake of the nonexistent food.
