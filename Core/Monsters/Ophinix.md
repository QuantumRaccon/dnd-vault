## Description
---
>This bat-like creature has luxurious blue fur covering every part of its body. It has a heavily wrinkled face, large, bulbous eyes, and twin horn-like antennae. Thin sable wings unfurl from its back, and its fur emits tiny sparks of blue lightning.

**_Cave-Dwelling Hunters_**. A large, bat-like monstrosity native to many natural cave systems and chasms, the ophinix spends most of its time flying through the darkened passages of its home looking for its next meal. The ophinix is single-minded in its pursuit of prey, hunting [[bat \|bats]], [[darkmantle \|darkmantles]], [[giant moth \|giant moths]] (Creature Codex), giant beetles, and even the occasional unwary miner. For this reason, a nest of these creatures can present a major threat to mining operations or the establishment of underground outposts, and bounties for them are common.

**_Lightning Bats_**. The ophinix has a natural affinity for lightning, and its fur can absorb massive amounts of static electricity. It can direct this electricity in bolts of lightning at its enemies. When charged with static, its fur emits sparks of dim blue light. It usually discharges this static before it goes hunting to avoid being seen by its prey.

**_Wings in the Darkness_**. Though most subterranean races see ophinixes as nothing more than nuisances, they are sometimes tamed and used as guard beasts or mounts by smaller humanoids like derro and [[deep gnome (svirfneblin) \|deep gnomes]]. Those riding an ophinix must use a specialized saddle and wear thick clothing to prevent themselves from being shocked by the creature's electrically-charged fur, but many are willing to risk the potential danger if it means securing such a formidable ally.
