## Description
---
>A fiend with yellow skin covered in Infernal script examines a scroll as its pointed, ink-drenched tail twitches, eager to make corrections.

Scribe devils are the ill-tempered authors of infernal contracts, which outline deals between mortals and devils.
**_Masters of Legal Logic_**. No fiends better understand the power of bureaucracy and a written contract than scribe devils. Able to draw up a contract for a deal at a moment's notice, these devils carefully select every letter of a written deal. Typically, their ink-soaked tails craft documents that confuse and misdirect mortals into raw deals. If a fellow fiend gets on a scribe devil's bad side or in the way, the scribe devil has no qualms about writing a bad contract for the fiend.

**_Contract Makers_**. Scribe devils make their documents from the skins of damned mortals acquired with the fiend's knife-like claws. Their ink is the blood of ink devils, who scribe devils enjoy bullying and bleeding.

**_Servants of Totivillus_**. Scribe devils are direct charges of [[Totivillus, Scribe of Hell \|Totivillus]] (Tome of Beasts). The archdevil keeps detailed records of the contracts they write and oversees their work, rewarding those who write clever deals and punishing his sloppier scribes.
