## Description
---
_A long-limbed, pale humanoid with a skinless head and saucerâ€‘shaped eyes stumbles forward. A steady drizzle of blood descends from its crown, painting its face, shoulders, and back a deep crimson._

**_Under Bridge and Under Stairs_**. Though their lairs can be found anywhere, bloody bones most often occupy the spaces under stairways and bridges. There, they suckle at the trailing dark energies left behind by great betrayals or atrocities, often driving humanoids to commit such atrocities by imitating others they have seen and heard. They are sometimes found near a ghost's haunt, where their appetite for pained memories can be sated.


**_Dark Influence_**. Creatures who live within a few miles of where a bloody bones rests are often filled with unexplainable dread, anger, and despair. Violent crimes and uncharacteristic sadness are both tell-tale signs that a bloody bones dwells nearby.
