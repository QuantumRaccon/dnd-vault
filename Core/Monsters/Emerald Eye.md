## Description
---
_Witches and ioun mages know how to craft a speaking crystal. Its primary use is as a debating companion and allyâ€”but many turn to treachery and hatred. These are the emerald eyes._

**_Servants of Logic_**. A mystic or psion will debate logic with a speaking crystal based on his rational mind, or discuss morality with a speaking crystal based on his conscience. Chaotic psions create speaking crystals based on their primal urges, and such crystals sometimes abandon or even kill their creators. Once free, they revel in the world's pleasures.

**_Trapped Manipulators_**. Most speaking crystals are pink or purple when created, but those that betray their creators turn a dark shade of green. These floating oval-shaped crystals are physically weak, but they retain considerable magical powers to manipulate those around them. This becomes critically important when the emerald eye discovers that killing its creator frees it from the creator's control but doesn't free it from the need to remain within 25 feet of some creature it is bound to. This is often the dead body of its creator if no other creature is available.

**_Shifting Goals_**. An emerald eye's motivations change over time. One may be purposeful, using its powers to drive its bound creature toward some specific goal. Another might feign cooperativeness, offering to share its defensive abilities in exchange for the creature's mobility. Still another might be a manipulative trickster, pretending to be an [[ioun stone]], floating in circles around an ally's or victim's head while sparkling brightly to inspire jealousy and theft among its viewers.
maller than a clenched fist, an emerald eye weighs at most half a pound.
