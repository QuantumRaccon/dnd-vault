## Description
---
_These light brown, furred creatures inquisitively survey their surroundings, each comforted by the presence of the others._

**_Friendly Farmers_**. Burrowlings work together at every task: digging tunnels, foraging, and rearing their young. They are omnivorous, eating roots, berries, insects, and reptilesâ€”and they consider snakes a particular delicacy. The most advanced burrowling towns set up rudimentary farms, where they grow the fruits and vegetables they usually find in the wild.

**_Safe Warrens_**. Some towns have domesticated prairie dogs, which burrowlings train to stand watch alongside their masters. Pairs of adults stand watch around the town perimeter and sound a warning when they spot a foe. An alerted town retreats to the safety of its warrens, while the strongest creatures add more tunnels if necessary, and close access from the surface until the threat has passed. In combat, burrowlings stand together in defense of the helpless young and fight with crude slings or their sharp teeth and claws.

**_Die of Loneliness_**. If separated from its coterie, a burrowling becomes despondent, crying for others of its kind. A lone burrowling usually dies of loneliness within a week, unless it can find its way back to its town or discover another burrowling town. Rarely, a solitary creature makes its way to a non-burrowling settlement where it attempts to assist its new community. This frustrates the creature and those it interacts with as it tries to anticipate what its companions want. It may join an adventuring party in the hope of returning to a settlement. After spending at least six months with a party, the burrowling can use its Burrow Tactics ability with its new allies.
Burrowlings live up to 15 years. Twice a year, a burrowling female bears a litter of up to three pups, but in especially dangerous regions, the creatures breed prodigiously to keep their population ahead of massive attrition. In cases like this, a female has a litter of five pups every other month. A burrowling pup reaches adulthood in a year.

>Burrowling towns are found in the Western Wastes, where their greatest enemies are dust goblins. They seem to thrive in the badlands and magically scant territories of former human settlements.
