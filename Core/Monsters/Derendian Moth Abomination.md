## Description
---
>The creature's multicolored moth wings slow to a flutter as it lands. The tentacles surrounding its mouth wriggle at the prospect of a new meal.

**_Cursed Origins_**. A dark tree resides in the depths of a forest where the veil between the Material and Shadow Realms is thin. Once a year, a heart-shaped growth on the tree beats, imbuing a nearby creature with shadow. The creature grows in size and power and becomes the tree's avatar in the mortal world. It spends its short life tending to and protecting its parent and the other shadowtouched trees of the forest.
