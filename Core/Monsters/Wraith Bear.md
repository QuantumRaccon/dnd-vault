## Description
---
>The black, spectral form of an enormous bear with burning red eyes lets loose a bone-chilling roar.

**_Corrupted Spirits_**. Bear spirits are believed to be the spirits of ancestral warriors and guardians that take on the form of a bear to aid their descendants. Necromancers and dark shamans know magic that twists the mind of these spirits, causing them to feel anger and malice toward the family they once protected. These wraith bears hunt and murder their descendants, listening to no other commands until they have murdered what remains of their family. When this mission is complete, the wraith bear returns to its corruptor, following orders loyally.

**_Forest Haunters_**. If a wraith bear's corruptor dies and the creature has no family left to hunt, it retreats to the forest. There the bear wanders, its hatred for all life a festering madness that drives it to violence. The wraith bear's mere presence begins to kill nearby plant life, and it attacks any living creature it finds.

**_Restored by Archfey_**. A wraith bear can be reinstated as a bear spirit by the touch of a fey lord or lady. Finding a fey lord or lady is difficult enough, but convincing it to take on such a task usually involves paying a heavy price.

**_Undead Nature_**. A wraith bear doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
