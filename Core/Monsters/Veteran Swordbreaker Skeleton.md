## Description
---
Tougher than a typical animated skeleton, these undead are raised from skeletal remains that have fossilized.
**_Bones of Stone_**. The swordbreaker skeleton's bones have fossilized and become stony. Most weapons shatter against these bones, but the fossilization makes the skeletons more susceptible to magic that harms stone or that causes concussive bursts of sound.

**_Undead Nature_**. A swordbreaker skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


**_Swordbreaker Skeleton Template_**. Any creature that has been dead for more than 100 years and that has a skeletal structure can be animated as a swordbreaker skeleton. When a creature is animated as a swordbreaker skeleton, it retains its statistics except as described below.
**_Type_**. The skeleton's type changes to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

**_Alignment_**. The skeleton's alignment changes to lawful evil.

**_Armor Class_**. The creature has a natural armor class of 13 + its Dexterity modifier.

**_Ability Scores_**. The skeleton's Intelligence score is reduced to 6 (+-2), if it was higher, otherwise it retains its Intelligence score. Its Wisdom score changes to 8 (+-1), and its Charisma score changes to 5 (+-3).

**_Damage Vulnerabilities_**. The skeleton is vulnerable to thunder damage.

**_Damage Resistances_**. The skeleton has resistance to piercing and slashing damage.

**_Damage Immunities_**. The skeleton is immune to poison damage.

**_Condition Immunities_**. The skeleton is immune to [[exhaustion]] and the [[poisoned]] and [[petrified]] conditions.

**_Senses_**. The skeleton gains [[darkvision]] with a radius of 60 feet.

**_Languages_**. The skeleton understands all languages it knew in life but it can't speak.

**_New Trait: Fossilized Bones_**. Any nonmagical slashing or piercing weapon made of metal or wood that hits the swordbreaker skeleton cracks. After dealing damage, the weapon takes a permanent and cumulative −1 penalty to damage rolls. If its penalty drops to −5, the weapon is destroyed. Nonmagical ammunition made of metal or wood that hits the swordbreaker skeleton is destroyed after dealing damage.
