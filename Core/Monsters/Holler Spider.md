## Description
---
While the chitinous horn-like protrusion makes holler spiders appear comical, they can use it to release a loud sound, calling their masters when they detect trespassers. Unlike most spiders, holler spiders are easy to domesticate, as they have a friendly disposition toward humanoids. They can be trained to act as sentries that recognize certain colors or livery, or they can be trained to respond to a certain person and sound alarms only when instructed. Some holler spiders can also be trained in different pitches or to carry a simple tune. This peculiarity has endeared them to nobles using holler spiders as fanfares at royal functions and to entertainers using the spiders to enhance their performances.



Some holler spiders are taught to listen to the sounds they hear and to react accordingly. These spiders are commonly used by entertainers and are known as backup holler spiders because they back up their owner's music or vocals. A backup holler spider has the following reaction option in place of Sound Alarm:

**_Tune Up_**. When an ally within 15 feet of the backup spider casts a spell that deals thunder damage, the backup holler spider chooses one of the spell's targets. The target has disadvantage on the saving throw against the spell.
