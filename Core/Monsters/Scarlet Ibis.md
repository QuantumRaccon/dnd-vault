## Description
---
>This gigantic marsh bird has blood-red feathers and a scythe-like beak. Its eyes shine with intelligence as it scans its surroundings.

**_Accursed Bird_**. Scarlet ibises are not inherently malevolent, and many visitors to the swamp assume they are natural, if overly large, birds. However, their beaks bestow unluck on those touched or struck by them. The ibises usually reserve their cursed attacks as retribution for themselves, but swamp dwellers sometimes plea for the birds' intercession on those who have wronged them. Scarlet ibises have keen judgment to determine the worthiness of these requests.
Those who know about scarlet ibises and their terrible curses avoid killing the birds and typically warn others about the consequences of killing them. Less scrupulous folk instead encourage na√Øve travelers to destroy a scarlet ibis then pick off the travelers suffering from the aftereffects of combat with the birds.

**_Egret Harpy Friends_**. Scarlet ibises congregate with [[egret harpy \|egret harpies]] and enjoy mutual protection. Uninformed observers believe the ibises are the harpies' pets, at least until they witness conversations between the two. Egret harpies never ask the ibises to curse enemies regardless of circumstances, but ibises who witness or know of attacks on egret harpy companions take it upon themselves to inflict bad luck in revenge.
