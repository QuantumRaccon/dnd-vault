## Description
---
>Appearing as a well-muscled humanoid with the lower body of a serpent, this hideous yet strangely majestic creature is covered in thick, golden scales. A flaming emerald crest frames its bestial face, and it holds a red-hot trident in its hands.

**_Salamander Kings and Queens_**. Salamanders rule over vast swaths of the Elemental Plane of Fire, contesting with the [[efreeti]] and [[azer \|azers]] for dominion over the region. Leading the race in their plans of conquest and violence are the salamander monarchs, powerful sovereigns that appear similar to [[salamander \|normal salamanders]] but have thick, golden scales and flaming crests upon their heads: emerald for females and azure for males. Both sexes are treated equally in salamander society, though female salamander monarchs are more common and are responsible for ensuring the survival of the salamander race.

**_Symbols of Adoration_**. Despite their impulsive natures, salamanders never willingly disobey the commands of a salamander monarch, and most are willing to lay down their lives for one if the need arises. This conditioning is bred into salamanders from birth, and much of their society is built on it.
