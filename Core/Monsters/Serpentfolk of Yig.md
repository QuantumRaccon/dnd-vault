## Description
---
_The hooded cultist utters a sibilant phrase. Then, like a fading mask of fog, his face suddenly vanishes and in its stead leers a monstrous serpent's head. His terrible, slit eyes blaze unblinkingly as his scaly hands twist and contort in arcane gestures._

**_Priests of the Serpent God_**. Grim tales are told of a prehistoric race of evil snake-people who, wearing the guise of a human cult, have surreptitiously built a monstrous religion around the worship of—the serpent god Yig. As an actor dons a mask, these fiendish humanoids use illusory magic to imitate anyone they wish. This disguise is often betrayed, however, by the presence of the serpentfolk's frightful, fetid scent

**_Under Cloak of Blasphemy_**. Serpentfolk of Yig rely on natural cunning and the sorcery of their cold, reptilian bloodline to survive. These snake-people live in secret amongst the cities of civilized nations and plot to overthrow the warm-blooded inheritors of the world "when the stars are right." Known as "they that walk the night," the serpentfolk of Yig live to serve their dark god's hideous, evil agenda. Many seek to become powerful spellcasters and master assassins to better serve their cruel life's purpose. The Queen of Serpents (see page 34) considers the serpentfolk abominations, corrupted versions of true serpents, and there is great enmity between her followers and the followers of Yig.

**_The Snake That Speaks_**. In defiance of the creation myths surrounding the World Serpent Veles, the serpentfolk worship their Great Old One progenitor as the true Father of Serpents, knowing him by many names—Set, Quetzelcoatl, and Ningishzida among them. As their insidious cults grow in size—swollen with allied horrors like the Servants of Yig, the [[scitalis]], and other reptilian monstrosities—the serpentfolk move further and further from their shadowed jungle enclaves to corrupt the credulous kingdoms of man.
