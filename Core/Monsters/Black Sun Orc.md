## Description
---
_Pale-skinned and strong as an ox, the Black Sun orcs worship strength and violence and feast on the cracked bones of their enemies._

**_Hidden by the Earth_**. Black Sun orcs excel at concealing their deeds from those on the surface world, lying in wait at night to abduct victims from the roads or their homes in near complete silence. The orcs bundle off such unfortunates to the concealed caverns leading to their homes beneath the earth, where they hand the captives over to their priestesses for sacrifice.

**_Nocturnal Attacks_**. Black Sun orcs are strictly nocturnal, avoiding the eye of the sun in favor of raids under moonlightâ€”and even these do not take place during the full moon.

**_Foes of Trolls and Goblins_**. Trolls, trollkin, and goblins find the fish-bellied coloration and peculiar speech of Black Sun orcs hilarious and mock them mercilessly. In most cases, this ends in a fight with one side or the other driven away.
