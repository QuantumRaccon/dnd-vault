## Description
---
_This gray-skinned dog-like creature seems pathetically eager to please but fantastically skittish, its ears alerting at every nearby sound, and its large oval eyes following anything that passes by._

**_Emotional Giant_**. A hulking whelp is a tightly wound ball of emotion, extremely private and defensive of its personal space, and terrified of the world around it. When it feels its personal space violated, or its fragile concentration is broken, the small, quivery fey grows into a muscled beast of giant proportions.

**_Calm Friend_**. When its emotions are under control, a hulking whelp is friendly and even helpful, although this has more to do with its guilt over past actions and fear of what it might do if it feels threatened than a true desire to help others. In its [[hulking whelp (calm form) \|calm form]], a hulking whelp is just over three feet tall at the shoulder and weighs 50 lb. Unleashed, it is 20 feet tall and 4,000 lb.
