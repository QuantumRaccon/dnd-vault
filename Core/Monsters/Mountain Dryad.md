## Description
---
>An enormous woman covered in rocky formations accented with crystals emerges from the mountainside.

Often mistaken for giants, mountain dryads are huge fey who are tied to primal mountains.
**_Like the Mountain_**. Mountain dryads are sturdier than their smaller, frailer sisters. Their beauty is more rugged, with hair the color of lichen and skin the shade of their mountain's stone.

**_Despise Mining_**. Mountain dryads tend to spend long stretches of time sleeping deep within their mountains, and they do not take kindly to the scarring of their homes. The dryads have a particular dislike for dwarves, kobolds, and others who make their living mining mountains.
