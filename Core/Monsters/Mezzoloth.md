## Description
---


Some yugoloths have an action option that allows them to summon other yugoloths.

**_Summon Yugoloth (1/Day)_**. The yugoloth attempts a magical summoning.
A mezzoloth has a 30 percent chance of summoning one mezzoloth.
A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, does as it pleases, and can't summon other yugoloths. The summoned yugoloth remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action to dismiss it.
