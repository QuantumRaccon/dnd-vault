## Description
---
_The mechanical servant offers drinks and conversation, though it is prone to uncoordinated jerks and occasional graceless, lurching movements._

**_Advanced Social Skills_**. Clockwork servants have few defensive capabilities, though they boast enhanced minds compared to other clockwork automata. Particularly expensive clockwork servants can even carry on full conversations, though their memory gears must be routinely replaced or they develop something quite close to emotion and free will. They understand the basic language, etiquette, and protocol of their country of creation.
