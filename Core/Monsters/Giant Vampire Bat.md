## Description
---
_A great bat the size of a horse with black and brown fur. As it shrieks, its blood-caked muzzle reveals long, yellowed fangs._

Some bats subsist on a diet of fresh blood. Unlike their smaller relatives, giant vampire bats are blessed by Camazotz and have no need to stalk sleeping prey. They are large enough to seize the blood they crave.
