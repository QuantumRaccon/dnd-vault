## Description
---
>Human hands sit at the ends of the raccoon-headed creature's four short legs. It flicks its banded tail as it turns toward cries for help, setting its vivid blue eyes on those in need.

**_Good Samaritans_**. Astri range the badlands and deserts of the Material Plane, seeking opportunities to assist lost and dying travelers. When an astri encounters people in distress, it works to grant them the assistance they need—be it food, healing, or a safe place to rest—and remains until they no longer require its help.

**_Bringers of Hope_**. When they aren't helping individuals or small groups, astri quietly watch over villages in their territories. They keep the surroundings clear of threats, aerate the soil, and dig out wells in places with limited access to clean water. Astri become quite fond of the settlements under their protection and take pride in the residents' successes.

**_Enemies of Greed_**. Mercenary behavior offends the sensibilities of astri, but they understand many people have strong selfish streaks. Astri counter this selfishness by magically enforcing the desire to help others. Before an astri assists an intelligent creature, it asks the creature to promise to do good deeds over the next few weeks. If a creature won't make the promise, the astri still assists, but the creature must contend with the [[geas]] that may be attached to the helping hand.


> [!INFO] Astri in Midgard
>Astri sightings are most common in the Wasted West. The celestials are known to the dust goblins of the wastes, especially members of the Maimed Ones and Scarlet Rovers who skirmish with them.
>Astri are also known in the Southlands. They are particularly active in the Crescent Desert, where most of the small villages and settlements have been adopted by the benevolent creatures. Astri are treated as divine messengers of Aten by some Southlands tribes who leave gifts of sweetmeat and cream for them.
