## Description
---
_An elder race—much older than the elves, and as old as the dragons, they claim—red hags are the most cunning and longest-lived of the hags, having a lifespan of more than a thousand years._

**_Beautiful and Strong_**. Unlike their hag kin, red hags are not horrid to look upon, and most are considered comely in their own right. Few know anything about them, and the hags do little to enlighten them, preferring their seclusion.

**_Tied to Nature_**. The hags have a deep connection with all elements of nature, and they often make their homes in deep forests, in caves, or alongside coastlines.

**_Blood Magic_**. Because of their close connection to nature, red hags often serve as druids. Within their druidic circles, however, they practice blood sacrifices and perform ritualistic blood magic—both to slake their craving for humanoid blood, but also as a means to venerate Hecate, goddesses of dark magic. Red hags also favor the cleric and wizard classes; few ever seek a martial path. The ancient hags all answer to a hierarchy.

>Red hags are more sociable among their own kind than other hags are, and may even live in small communities in remote areas. In ancient times, they settled together in larger clusters and ruled small cities of mixed populations—especially in Old Verrayne. Their current leader is Blood Mother Margase, an ancient druid.
>Their greatest city, Talitheos, an island metropolis of vast wealth and magical knowledge, sunk during the cataclysm, and the hags have been seeking its ruins ever since.
