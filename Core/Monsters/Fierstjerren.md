## Description
---
_An ancient man with dead eyes, long white hair, and tattooed runes covering his still-muscular body bears his sword menacingly._

Fierstjerren are undead servants of the northern death cults, raised from fallen reavers through dark magic. They are boastful and arrogant, and injury only makes them stronger.

**_Relentless Agents_**. Fierstjerren carry out the orders of their creators with independence and foresight, while others independently further the cause of evil as they see fit.


**_Malevolence Under Tension_**. Fierstjerren are animated by a controlling spirit of necrotic energy. When the fierstjerren is wounded, the spirit tears free, animating the twice-undead corpse in a burst of necromantic destruction.


**_Accompanied by Zealots_**. Fierstjerren are often accompanied by a dozen thrallsâ€”humanoid zealots serving the cult, willingly or not, who view the fierstjerren as an avatar of death and will follow it to the grave and beyond. Thralls attack under the direction of the fierstjerren, who is alerted to any danger the thralls perceive. A fierstjerren will sacrifice its thralls without remorse to secure an advantage, a sacrifice that is often seen as an honor by the zealous thralls.


**_Undead Nature_**. The fierstjerren doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
