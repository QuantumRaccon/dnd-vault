## Description
---
_This bulky crustacean generates a magnetic pulse that draws metal to its growing, shell-like shelter._

**_Metal Scavenger_**. A shoreline scrapper instinctively seeks metal and gathers it using a magnetic pulse. The creature's accumulated metal forms a portable shelter that acts as its shell.

**_Hunted for Hoard_**. A shoreline scrapper's hoard might include more than just rusty debris. As a result of scavenging a shipwreck or sunken city, its metal shell may contain valuables. For this reason, treasure seekers sometimes hunt shoreline scrappers. They hope to uncover riches from the creature's metal-hoard shell, but those foolish enough to engage a shoreline scrapper while equipped with metal rarely survive.

**_Conditioned for War_**. Some aquatic and coastal races train shoreline scrappers for combat. On command, shoreline scrappers charge toward enemies and disarm them of metal equipment. Deployed soldiers then enter the fray to annihilate their vulnerable enemies.
