## Description
---


Some anvilwrought raptors are created expressly to be familiars. Such creatures have the following trait.

**_Familiar_**. The anvilwrought can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magical, telepathic bond with its willing master. While the two are bonded, the master can sense what the anvilwrought senses, as long as they are within 1 mile of each other.
