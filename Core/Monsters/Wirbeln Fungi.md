## Description
---
_A strange, mushroom-shaped creature leaps and flies through the air, spraying spores below itself._

Wirbeln are spiral-shaped bipedal fungi that appear in an array of colors. Each individual is a specific hue that indicates the type of spores it produces. Wirbeln fungi cause minor coloration changes as a form of communication, depending on mood, temperament, or personality.

**_Symbiotic Nomads_**. The wirbeln fungi's origin is lost to history. Those familiar with the creatures know they are wanderers who roam until they find a suitable home, usually in deep and wild places. Home for the wirbeln fungi is best defined by the deep-rooted companionship they develop with other races, rather than a specific location. The wirbeln fungi form allegiances with numerous species, such as elves, gnomes, treants, and others.


**_Fierce Protectors_**. The main strength of wirbeln fungi is their ability to turn back adversaries threatening their gatherings. The extreme loyalty of the wirbeln reveals itself through a determination to defend its chosen community, even if such defense is detrimental to the individual wirbeln.


**_Cunning Controllers_**. Wirbeln fungi employ diversionary tactics, using their numbers and the natural terrain to their advantage to shirk capture and harass enemies. The wirbeln fungi continually fly out of reach, landing on high ledges or branches. They attack by shooting poisonous darts and dropping on enemies from above. They utilize body-and mind-altering spores with overwhelming effects.
