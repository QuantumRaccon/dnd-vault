## Description

>A gold-furred, lion-headed angel with white wings gives an intense stare, releasing a roar as it raises a flaming greatsword.

Angelic enforcers are lion-headed celestials that hunt rogue angels.
**_Divine Mission_**. Angelic enforcers are made from souls selected for their unwavering adherence to the tenants of law and good. These elite angels have a special task: police other angels that go rogue. If an angel breaks one of its god's tenets but remains good at heart, the enforcers usually only seek to capture the offending celestial to stand trial in the upper planes. If an angel becomes fully corrupted by evil, one or more enforcers are sent to destroy the fallen celestial.

**_Nothing Gets in the Way_**. Angelic enforcers show no mercy to any creature or obstacle between them and their quarries. Those who obstruct the enforcers stand in the way of divine justice and are therefore considered agents of evil. Any killings or collateral damage done by enforcers are usually seen as the fault of their quarry for stepping out of line in the first place.

**_Immortal Nature_**. An angelic enforcer doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
