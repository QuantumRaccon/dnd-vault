## Description
---


Some adult fire giants are trained to lay siege to strongholds and break through enemy lines. These abilities are represented by the following traits.

**_Siege Monster_**. The giant deals double damage to objects and structures.
**_Tackle_**. When the giant enters any enemy's space for the first time on a turn, the enemy must succeed on a DC 19 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].
