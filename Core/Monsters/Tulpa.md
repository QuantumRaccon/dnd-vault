## Description
---
_This spectral humanoid's shape and features closely resemble the humanoid it follows. Its eyes swirl with star-like lights, and its skin is loose and pale. Overly large black claws tip its long fingers._

**_Manifestations_**. Tulpa are a coalescence of ill-will and obsessive thoughts. Brought into the Material Plane from pure negative thoughts, the tulpa is effectively immortal-remaining in the world until its creator ceases thinking dark thoughts. The tulpa heeds no commands and follows its creator at a distance, haunting its creator and attacking those who get too close. 

**_Beacons of Darkness_**. While there is never more than one tulpa associated with a single creature, a tulpa's birth and continued existence draws malevolent things to it. Lesser undead and beastly evil are attracted to the tulpa, and its creator may regularly be pursued by a growing host of darkness.
