## Description
---
_This fearsome warrior-giant stands guard in front of a pair of great doors, brandishing a large, bronze mace. He has a huge, block-like physique, thick arms and legs, large ears, and a monstrous face dominated by a mouth full of sharp teeth. He wears a skirt and several pieces of gold jewelry but is otherwise unclothed, as if to better show off his impressive belly._

**_Divine Door Guardians_**. Dvarapala are a race of semiâ€‘divine giants who serve the various gods of the East, standing guard over their most sacred temples and shrines. Normally encountered in pairs or in even numbers, one dvarapala will be stationed on each side of the temple entrance with another pair inside, guarding the doorway into the inner sanctum. The dvarapala take orders from the god's servants, ensuring that only those allowed to enter the temple are admitted.


**_Touched by the Gods_**. Although all dvarapala are both larger-than-life and martial, their appearances and costumes vary based on the attributes of their divine master. A dvarapala serving a god of war, for example, might appear more ferocious, while one sworn to a god of the morning might have skin that gleams with a golden glow. Its weapons vary as well, but huge gadas (maces) are favored by most dvarapala to knock intruders down the temple steps or bludgeon them into submission.
