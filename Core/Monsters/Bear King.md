## Description
---
Dressed in hunting leathers with a thick bearskin cloak around his shoulders, the bearded king sits upon a throne carved from a whole tree trunk. A crown of holly leaves wreathes his head, and a blackened maul rests near his hand. An ornate clay pot filled with honey hangs at his hip at all times.

Mesikammen the Bear King, called "Old Honey Paws," rules the northern kingdom of Bjeornheim. The Kingdom of the Bear is home to a great population of its namesake. The forests are thick with bears, and werebears are common among its people.

**_Abuzz with Bees_**. The country's chief product and export, thanks to the Bear King's insatiable appetite for sweets, is honey. The Bear King's hive-keepers harvest rich, blossom-sweet honey from the hives of giant bees they tend. The land's brewers use the honey to create the finest mead, and the most potent brews are infused with fey glamour.
The Bear King and his court of bear jarls, witches, and oracles spend most of their time hunting in the hills, feasting, brawling, and drinking mead. Old Honey Paws maintains his rulership over this court by besting all rivals in a yearly series of challenges. The challenges are open to anyone, but the Bear King has defeated all comers since he rose to the throne.

**_Fey Lords and Ladies_**. Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings, but despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.
**_Heads of State_**. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's rule, in his or eyes, a fey ruler's word is law, and so shall the rest of the world see it! Outsiders may not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

**_Circles of Power_**. Each fey noble is supreme in his or her own bailiwick, and the rulers maintain a rigid hierarchy among themselves. Thee Queen of Night and Magic is undeniably the most powerful of all fey nobles, and she rules cyclically with her embittered husband, the Moonlit King. Together, the Summer and Winter monarchs rule over the entire shadow fey race. Thee River King is next in power, and he rules over the river elves of the Arbonesse forest. Thee Snow Queen rules among the ice, snow, and plundering reavers of the far north, as wells as commanding the obedience of the [[fraughashar]] and [[ice maiden \|ice maidens]]. The Bear King, the weakest politically, rules a northerly city-state where [[werebear \|werebears]] are common and mead flows like water.
Thee odd man out is the Lord of the Hunt. Though he is associated with both the shadow fey and the light elves, no one is certain of his true identity or how he fits into the political structure of fey nobility. Because he seldom concerns himself with politics, few have felt any need to press the question.
Other fey courts and rulers certainly exist, though their rulers are more esoteric than those described here.

**_Vacant Thrones_**. When a lord or lady dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the station of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.


> [!INFO] Touch of Iron
>Lords and ladies of the fey courts are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats. A universal exception to this is weapons of cold-wrought iron. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh. A cold iron weapon is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies.
>Cold iron weapons, however, are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficult—and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.

**_Bear King's Lair_**. The Bear King lairs in the capital of Bjeornheim, the Gloaming Crag. This fortress thrusts up from the foothills of a mountain range like a petrified wave. The Crag is riddled with caves and tunnels, and there dwells the court of the Bear King.
