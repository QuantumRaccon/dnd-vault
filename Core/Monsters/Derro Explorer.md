## Description
---
>The small humanoid sets its claw-toothed boots into the rock, steadying itself, then looses an arrow. Its lips curl into a cruel smile as a cry of surprise and shouts of alarm resound in the dark cavern.

Deep beneath the earth, the derro gather in clans and worship beings that dwell between the stars. Lifelong exposure to these beings damages the psyche of the mortal derro, leaving most reliant on the powers of their dark masters.
