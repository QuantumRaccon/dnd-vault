## Description
---
_Smelling a bit like ozone and looking like a cloud of glowing lights, this ooze is filled with strange lines of dots and nerve-like filaments._

**_Cloud of Glowing Lights_**. From a distance, a foxfire ooze often resembles swamp gas or a cloud of fireflies. Its amorphous shape is filled with tiny glowing lights, generally green or yellow but sometimes orange, blue, purple, or even pink. A potential prey's curiosity is often what brings it close enough to strike.

**_Natural Swimmers_**. Foxfire oozes are able to swim for short distances. Some even use ponds, slow-moving streams, or underground pools as lairs and breeding areas.

**_Open Sky Hunter_**. Foxfire oozes are not relegated to caverns and dim sewers and are often found in rivers, forests, marshlands, and even sometimes in open plains, especially when storms threaten. A foxfire ooze encountered during a lightning storm is particularly aggressive.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A foxfire ooze doesn't require sleep.
