## Description
---
_Doors flew open, and gates lifted as the draconic humanoid approached the castle. All locks failed, and a glowing portal opened between the roots of the courtyard chestnut tree. It opened its mouth to speak the words of the dragon gods._

**_Opener of the Ways_**. Rare indeed is the arrival of a herald of the Great Wyrm, the Keeper of Portals, the Opener of the Ways and Lord of Dragons. All locks, stoppers, chests, wards, and doors are said to spring open when it treads near, and gates and shadow portals pop into existence at its bidding. The herald of the great wyrm is a sign that the eye of dragonkind is upon a particular place or personâ€”perhaps the thief of a great treasure, perhaps a great treasure to be taken.


**_Keeper of Knowledge_**. The herald of the Great Wyrm knows of all scrolls, books, maps, and even carvings and graffiti within 10 miles of its location. No source of lore or writing can be hidden from it.
