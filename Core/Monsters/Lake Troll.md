## Description
---
_This large, lanky creature has arms too long for its body. Its hands are webbed and equipped with wicked claws. Its skin is covered in dull green scales and embedded with stones,, and limp hair like scraggly seaweed hangs across its long-nosed face._

Water-dwelling cousins of the more common trolls, lake trolls are both stronger and slightly more intelligent, but thankfully less common. Accompanied by a reek of old, rotting fish, these slimy creatures live beneath the surface of lakes, ponds, rivers, and sometimes even ocean coves.

**_Violently Territorial_**. A lake troll is savage in the defense of its claimed expanse of territory; any encroachment into the creature's water is met with sudden violence from the depths. Fishermen are the most vulnerable to these attacks, especially when they explore new bodies of water.

**_Cruel Cunning_**. Even seasoned soldiers are wise enough to fear the claws of a lake troll; a person with no weapon facing the creature is doomed. Lake trolls delight in splintering wood, twisting metal with their talons, and dulling blades on their tough hide. They often prioritize wielders of grand weapons so they can delight in the horror of their newly-disarmed prey. Lake trolls are cunning ambushers. They make use of the water to cover their attack and to protect themselves from the flames of would-be troll hunters.

**_Hard to Kill_**. A lake troll's regeneration is shut down only by cold and fire damage at nearly the same time, making them tricky to fight and exceedingly difficult to kill. Many adventurers have been shocked or slain when a lake troll they presumed was burned to death suddenly leapt back into the fray. Because they're reclusive and so very lethal, these creatures are poorly understood by most scholars.
