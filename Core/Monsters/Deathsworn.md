## Description
---
_The elf mutters softly to itself as it nocks an arrow in its ancient bow. In one fluid motion, the elf releases the arrow, blossoming with green fire, and leaps from cover, its blade striking a hair's breadth after its arrow._

A deathsworn elf is one of the elite soldiers of the elvish empire, sworn to the service of the elvish war god. Its speedy archery, swift and silent travel, and masterful ambushes make it feared and respected by all its foes. Many claim the title, but few deathsworn still walk the mortal world; most have retreated to their fey realms to fight against darkness elsewhere.

**_Bow Speech_**. Deathsworn have a reverence (some would say obsession) with their tools, in particular, their bows and arrows. They often wield particularly ancient, named heirloom weapons or those made by divine hands and given to elvesâ€”and they speak to their bows as if the makers or other spirits inhabit the weapons. This is quite disconcerting to other archers, as a deathsworn seems half-mad when most focused on its aim.


**_Keen Eyed_**. Deathsworn have an incredible knack for noticing precise details at a distance; the exact number of soldiers marching down a valley, the height of a palisade, or the speed of a current all seem to spring to their eyes. Others occasionally find their propensity to share this information a touch grating.


> [!INFO] Deathsworn in Midgard
>The deathsworn are the elite soldiers of Valeresh, the elvish god of war and justice, and were a foundation of elvish power. Most are believed to have returned to the Summer Lands, though they are occasionally found in the Arbonesse, Margreve, Gennecka, or other ancient forests. Widely referred to as "Valeran Deathsworn," they are feared by all reasonable mercenaries and soldiers of other nations.
