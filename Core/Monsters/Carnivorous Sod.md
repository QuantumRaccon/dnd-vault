## Description
---
>What was a mere patch of green grass suddenly uproots itself and shows its true form: a flat, turtle-like creature with a wide maw filled with sharklike wooden teeth.

**_Grassland Ambushers_**. The carnivorous sod is a plant monster that disguises itself as a simple patch of grass until it is stepped on. It then uses its grass-like tendrils to trip a creature before biting with its vicious jaws. Carnivorous sods typically prey on small herbivores, such as deer and rabbits, that come to graze on their backs, but they have been known to attack just about anything that treads on them as long as the target is Medium or smaller. Sometimes dozens of carnivorous sods gather together to hunt, though this is due more to happenstance than planning on the part of the monsters.

**_Links to the Fey_**. Carnivorous sods begin their lives when a fey creature such as a pixie or sprite enchants or simply lays on a patch of grass; the grass soon animates as a plant creature called a stray sod. Stray sods are cultivated by fey to protect their dwellings and fey rings. Eventually, should a stray sod survive for more than a year and be fed a drop of blood, or have blood accidentally spilled on it, it transforms into a carnivorous sod. Once a carnivorous sod is born, it can reproduce naturally through budding, a process which can quickly infest an area with these dangerous creatures.

**_Keep Off the Turf_**. Grassland-dwelling humanoids like [[gnoll \|gnolls]] and [[nkosi]] (Tome of Beasts) sometimes use carnivorous sods to guard their dwellings and encampments, keeping the sods moving along specific paths with the use of fences and trenches. Druids also use carnivorous sods as guardians, casting spells like [[plant growth]] on them to make them into formidable foes for any trespasser. Most notably, a [[treant]] may keep a carnivorous sod as a beloved pet.
