## Description
---
_A sleek serpent wends through the air, held aloft on bronzefeathered wings. The flying cobra flares its hood and hisses, hurling a spray of orange sparks from its fanged mouth._

A uraeus resembles a vibrantly colored cobra. The serpent's scales are the rich gold-flecked blue of lapis lazuli and its eyes gleam white, but its most distinguishing feature is a pair of feathery bronze wings. It glides gracefully through the air with a deliberate vigilance that reveals its intelligence. A uraeus grows up to three feet long, and weighs around 5 pounds.

**_Divine Protectors_**. Uraeuses are celestial creatures that carry a spark of divine fire within them, and they thirst for purpose when they arrive on the Material Plane. Whether the creature was deliberately summoned or found its way to the Material Plane through other means, a uraeus is created to protect. Once it finds a worthy charge, it devotes its fiery breath and searing venom to protecting that ward.
A uraeus is fanatically loyal to the creature it protects. Only gross mistreatment or vicious evil can drive a uraeus to break its bond and leave.
