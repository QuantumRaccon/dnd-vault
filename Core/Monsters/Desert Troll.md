## Description
---
_The creature rising from the sand stands to a towering height, its knobbled flesh blending with the parched ground. Its long arms flex, bringing up iron-hard claws._

Desert trolls, uniquely suited to survive in their wasteland environment, are stout and bulky with skin cracked and hardened like parched earth. They are more intelligent than their cousins, and their temperament allows them to curb their evil impulses with subtlety and patience. As such, they can even assimilate successfully into civilized society, living and working in major cities and other settlements.

**_Lurkers in Sand and Rock_**. More cunning than standard trolls, desert trolls revel in surprising their foes with sudden ambushes from beneath the sand. Their hardened claws allow them to tunnel through earth and sand, and their coloration suits them to blending with desolate surroundings. Civilized desert trolls often take up trades that allow them to leverage their burrowing, such as construction or grave digging.

**_Born of Fire, Death in Water_**. Unlike most creatures who live in parched wastes, desert trolls have no need of water at all. Quite to the contrary, water is the bane of these creatures, dissolving their flesh and bones like acid. Many adventurers have met a sudden end by falling back on old standbys to defeat trolls, only to die shocked as their fire and oil slide harmlessly off the desert troll's stony flesh.
