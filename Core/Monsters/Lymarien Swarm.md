## Description
---
>A tiny bird swoops through the air and alights on a nearby branch. It has the body of a tiny hawk, the colorful wings of a butterfly, and the head of an elf with large, luminous eyes.

**_Miniscule Fey_**. Dwelling in pastoral woods and rich farmland, the [[lymarien]] is one of the smallest fey in existence. Barely larger than a wasp, a lymarien is frequently mistaken for a butterfly and often ignored by larger creatures. They are sometimes preyed upon by birds like owls and crows, or attacked by evil fey like morkos.

**_Guardians of the Young_**. Lymariens have a fondness for fey and animal young, sometimes putting their lives at risk against superior opponents to save such creatures. When faced with a particularly powerful threat, lymariens form into massive, short-lived swarms, gaining potent magical abilities in the process.
