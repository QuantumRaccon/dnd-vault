## Description
---
Most sporous crabs spend a considerable amount of their lives in sewers and brackish ponds. The filth clings to them throughout their lives, and they are toxic to almost every creature they encounter. The sporous crab is usually found near the [[brachyura shambler]]. Both creatures are perfectly at home in filth, and they are likely related. The shamblers have far superior intelligence and thus have something resembling a cohesive society. By comparison, the sporous crabs are more akin to pets, guardians, or parasites. They support and protect the shamblers and may offer some form of companionship, but they are not equal members in the shambler society.
