## Description
---
_Often a shadhavar is first noticed for the haunting melody it makes, and some mistake them for unicorns or fey steeds. On closer inspection, they look like desiccated unicorns, their skeletons clearly visible beneath their taut flesh._

**_Shadow Horses_**. Shadhavar are natives of the plane of Shadow. Although they resemble undead unicorns, they are living creatures imbued with shadow essences.

**_Fey and Undead Riders_**. While the shadhavar are intelligent creatures, they sometimes serve as mounts for the shadow fey, noctiny, hobgoblins, wights, or other creatures. They expect to be treated well during such an arrangement; more than one unkind rider has ridden off on a shadhavar and never returned.

**_Deceptive Hunters_**. Shadhavar use their hollow horn to play captivating sounds for defense or to draw in prey. They hunt when they must and are not discriminating about their quarry, but shadhavar primarily eat carrion. Despite their horrific appearance, they are not naturally evil.
