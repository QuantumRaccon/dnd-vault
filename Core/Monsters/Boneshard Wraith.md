## Description
---
>A vaguely humanoid form appears, dim and hazy amid the constant swirl of wind-wracked grit and tainted dust of the magical wasteland.

Contorted and broken, the boneshard wraith is a ghostly horror, haphazardly assembled from mismatched bones and gravescavenged shards. Shattered eye sockets burn with the black, icy glow of eternal madness and the spiteful hunger of the Void.
**_Undead Nature_**. A boneshard wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


> [!INFO] Boneshard Wraiths in Midgard
>In the wake of the Battle of Flensing Gulch and the defeat of the last of Caelmarath's Indomitables by a summoned boneshard tempest, the nearly innumerable dead arose to haunt the area as boneshard wraiths, a form of undead creature only truly encountered in the Wasted West. The Bonewraith goblin tribe worships these creatures and sends their elders out to be consumed and transformed by them.
