## Description
---
_These drakes are resplendent in their natural form, plumed and scaled in glittering, multicolored hues. In humanoid form, they appear as elderly homespun human crones or as young, beautiful elvish women._

**_Drakes in Human Form_**. These faerie drakes can take the shape of wise, old, human women. They retain full use of their sorcerous powers in their humanoid forms, and they can retain that form indefinitely.

**_Difficult to Spot_**. A naina shapeshifted into human form is nearly impossible to spot as anything but human unless she makes a mistake that gives away her true nature, and they seldom do. Draconic roars, a flash of scales, a fondness for raw meat, and a flash of wrathful dragon breath are the most common tells.

**_Hunted by Rumor_**. When rumors of a naina circulate, any woman who is a stranger may be persecuted, ostracized, or even tortured unless she can prove that she's entirely human.

>The naina are employed by the Dragon Empire as spies, infiltrators, and agents provocateur. Some sages say they serve Baba Yaga, and she can speak through them.
