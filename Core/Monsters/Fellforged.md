## Description
---
_A darkly foreboding intelligence glows behind this automaton's eyes, and its joints seep hissing green vapors._

**_Wraith Constructs_**. Fellforged are the castoffs of gearforged and clockworks production, given foul sentience when the construct bodies attract wraiths yearning to feel the corporeal world. The clockwork bodies trap the wraiths, which dulls many of their supernatural abilities but gives them physical form. The wraiths twist the bodies to their own useâ€”going so far as to destroy the body to harm the living.

**_Soldiers for Vampires_**. Fellforged commonly seek out greater undead as their masters. Vampires and liches are favorite leaders, but banshees and darakhul also make suitable commanders.

**_Grave Speech_**. The voice of the fellforged is echoing and sepulchral, a tomb voice that frightens animals and children.

> [!INFO] Fellforged in Midgard
>Dwarves of Grisal canton create the fellforged to fight against undead haunts and spirits, and melt them down afterwards, destroying wraiths, ghosts, and other incorporeal undead. The fellforged are also sometimes created by the Emerald Order and other cults seeking to give their evil masters a body and a shape with which to rule.
