## Description
---
_Broken pieces of metal, clay, and wood fly together in an erratic tornado._

Most junk heaps are extremely forgettable. It takes refuse literally coming to life to leave lasting memories...and scars.

**_Recycled Guardians_**. The process for creating construct guardians requires an investment of energy, gold, and time. When one of these guardians is destroyed, a thrifty spellcaster taps the residual magic of the scraps to create a shard swarm. The creator strategically positions the swarm to look like a harmless pile of junk, so it can surprise intruders.

**_Surprise Cages_**. The pieces of a shard swarm can be spread far apart from one another and come together in an instant. Some creators use the swarms as living cages, ordering the shards to simply hold any uncooperative intruders until the creator performs a proper interrogation.




Some constructs are made entirely of stone and leave behind rubble when destroyed. A rubble swarm has the same statistics as a shard swarm, except that it deals bludgeoning damage with its attacks.
