## Description
---
_A glint of brilliant light shines from the forehead of a lithe cat-like creature covered in the vibrant plumage of a tropical songbird._

The carbuncle is a jungle-dwelling beast highly sought after by alchemists for the shining jewel embedded in its forehead. The carbuncle's body is not unlike an ocelot mixed with a bird of paradise; a lithe, four-legged quadruped with vibrant purple‑and-crimson plumage instead of fur. Despite their bestial appearance, carbuncles possess great cunning and build villages of their own in caves deep in the jungle.

**_Bearers of Precious Gems_**. The glimmering garnet in this creature's forehead—the carbuncle for which it is named—is more than just a precious stone. Alchemists and other arcanists spend exorbitant amounts on carbuncle hunters because the gem is rumored to hold the power to amplify magic like light through a magnifying lens. What few wizards understand is that the carbuncle's garnet only holds magical power if given willingly; a garnet pried from the skull of a slain carbuncle still shines beautifully (and is worth 300 gp in most markets) but is devoid of magic. If a carbuncle willingly removes the gem from its forehead and gives it to another creature, the gem regrows in **1d4** weeks.


**_Capricious Tricksters_**. Carbuncles are well aware of how much their precious gem is valued by humans and their ilk and rightly fear humanoids for their cruelty and greed. However, particularly courageous carbuncles fight back against the hunters. They are not large or powerful creatures and instead use their cunning mind to trick hunters into following them into pits of quicksand, the lairs of deadlier creatures, or into piranhainfested waters.
