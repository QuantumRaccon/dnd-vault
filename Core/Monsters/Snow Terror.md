## Description
---
>A sizeable snowperson with sticks for arms, a carrot nose, and a smile etched across its face slowly turns its head. Closer inspection reveals the smile is disturbingly jagged.

**_Demonic Snow People_**. Snow terrors hail from an icy layer of the Abyss. There, they torment lesser fiends or watch as windwhipped snow destroys visitors wholly unprepared for it. Such visitors are few and far between, leading snow terrors to travel to the Material Plane for greater chances at entertainment.

**_Innocuous Disguise_**. Snow terrors temper their desire for bloodshed and mayhem with patience. They find heavily trafficked areas and lurk nearby, observing potential prey. When choosing victims, they remain motionless in their guise as ordinary snowpersons, even allowing children to pluck the accoutrements off them.

**_Sadistic Hunter_**. A snow terror picks off lone people first, reveling in communities consequently thrown into chaos. Just before it attacks, it reveals its true form: a leering, shark-toothed snowperson with unholy light glowing in its eye sockets. It chases, catches, and devours its victims, relishing the screams as the acid churning in its guts slowly dissolves its prey. It can take on the appearance of its victims, drawing in concerned family members and neighbors before dissolving the facade to attack.
