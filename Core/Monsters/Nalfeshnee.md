## Description
---


The demon chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.

A nalfeshnee has a 50 percent chance of summoning **1d4** [[vrock]], **1d3** [[hezrou]], **1d2** [[glabrezu]], or one nalfeshnee.

A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner dismisses it as an action.
