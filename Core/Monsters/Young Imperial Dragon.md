## Description
---
>The long, serpentine dragon is wingless and possesses shimmering, opalescent scales. Its appearance is at once both serene and majestic.

**_Dragons of the Spirit World_**. Imperial dragons are tied to the world of celestials, fiends, and spirits. They freely parley with such creatures for knowledge about the outer planes or the fundamental mysteries of the universe. Some of the most powerful imperial dragons even become the servants of the gods in exchange for wisdom, acting as intermediaries between the divine and mortal realms.

**_Colorful and Magical_**. Imperial dragons are capable of changing their colors and forms. They are typically a rich, golden-yellow, but azure-, jade-, and vermillion-colored dragons are not unheard of, and even white and black imperial dragons have been reported. A magical organ in their skulls gives them the ability to fly without the aid of wings, and they are often hunted for this organ, which is rumored to grant eternal life if consumed.

**_Masters of Wind and Rain_**. Imperial dragons are creatures of wind and water, and the eldest of their kind exhibit mastery of these elements. They love the seas where they make their homes and sometimes act as guardians for sacred sites or temples near or beneath the waves. This often puts them in conflict with militant aquatic races like the [[sahuagin]] and evil water-dwelling monsters like [[kraken \|krakens]] and [[young sea dragon \|sea dragons]] (Tome of Beasts).


**_An Imperial Dragon's Lair_**. Imperial dragons live deep below the water, typically in large rivers, lakes, and seas. While some live in simple caves, most construct great palaces of coral and kelp. These magnificent structures contain areas where air-breathing creatures can live without discomfort, and the palaces of the oldest dragons are filled with menageries, bathhouses, and even entire libraries of rare and esoteric texts.
