## Description
---
_These spotted and scaly quadrupeds run on hairless leonine paws, while their cat heads perch atop sinuous, serpentine necks._

**_Swaying, Snakelike Cats_**. Serpopards are 13 feet long and weigh 600 lb, with little gender dimorphism. They have feline bodies but long, serpentine necks topped by vaguely draconic heads. Their hairless paws have wickedly curved, retractable talons. A serpopard's neck is in constant motion, swaying like a cobra, allowing it to track foes on all sides and to strike in unexpected directions.

**_Easily Distracted_**. Serpopards are foul-tempered predators and scavengers, and are known to occasionally resort to cannibalizing their weakest pack mate. They actively hunt humanoids when possible and also attack other predators to steal their killsâ€”or to kill and eat the predators, then take their kills. Serpopards are not tenacious hunters, however. They can be distracted from a pursuit by the appearance of an easier meal.

**_Musk Glands_**. In some culture, serpopard pelts and musk glands are prized for use in fashion and perfumes. Images of these odd animals appear regularly in southern tomb iconography and temple decoration.
