## Description
---
The ever twisting, wooden form of the cairnlord is a dreamy mockery of an archfey; a gangly humanoid comprised of gnarled branches, adorned with flora and moss. Their features are seemingly formed out notches in the bark itself as if a death mask crafted by a sculptor. It stands about 8 ft. tall, towering over the few mortals that visit its realm. Some cairnlords take on unique, animal qualities such as mock antlers or tails.

**_The Undying Fey_**. A cairnlord is created when a fey of power strives to achieve true immortality, connecting themselves completely to nature and sacrificing their body to it. As part of this ritual, they build a cairn of stones in a landscape of their choosing, to which they bind their soul in a similar way a lich would to a phylactery. From this point on, the cairnlord protects this land and draws immense power from it.
**_Fickle Masters of Nature_**. In order to gain favor from the local mortals, the cairnlord will hand out blessings and gifts in exchange for additions to their cairn and protection for it. Ancient cairnlords guard earthworks that tower above the tallest trees in their forests or rival the rolling hills. Over time, this construction will begin to feature treasures of various kinds and start to house wildlife. However, cairnlords are not benevolent and do seek to utterly control the lands they are bound to. As they grow in power, they seek to expand their territory, often coming into conflict with other forces. When this occurs, the cairnlord will stop at nothing to achieve domination, especially against another cairnlord as they seek to add the conquered cairn to their own.
**_A Cairnlord's Lair_**. A cairnlord claims ownership over an area of land at the heart of which is sequestered their cairn, a primitive structure of balanced stones that contains their soul. Other fey beings, and rarely some non-fey, can find themselves serving to protect this area in exchange for power or gifts. Nature in this area bends at the command of the cairnlord and wildlife flourishes here as long as the cairnlord wishes.
**_Regional Effects_**. The region around the cairnlord's cairn is effected by their strange magics in any of the following ways:
- The area in which the cairnlord is located is under the effect of a perpetual druid grove spell. The grasping undergrowth and mist seemingly react instinctively to hamper intruders. Four awakened trees are present in the area at all times, but will only attack at the cairnlord's command.
- The local flora and fauna grow rapidly and in unique ways. Animals of all varieties can be found in both unusually large and small forms. Trees can become twisted or barren, flowers can become carnivorous or exhibit odd colors.
- Recipients of restorative magic will find small flowers or stones growing from the affected areas. These wither, die and fall off within an hour of leaving the region.
- Altar-like stones emerge from the ground with regularity. The older examples of these stones are adorned with carvings, decorations and littered with offerings. Anyone who leaves an appropriate offering at one of these stones will earn the favor of the cairnlord, similarly, if anyone takes any of the offerings or desecrates the stone in any way they will earn its ire.
