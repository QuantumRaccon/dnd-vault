## Description
---
>Steam rises from the top of this bald, green-skinned humanoid with a snake-like torso. The creature sweats profusely, but it doesn't seem uncomfortable.

**_Protector of Hot Springs_**. Geothermal springs are the only reliable source of warmth in the arctic region, and they often coincide with ley lines. A hverhuldra, an aquatic fey, enjoys the constant heat provided by such springs and is sensitive to the magic power flowing through them. It serves as guardian of these coveted locations, ensuring no particular creature or group takes control of them.

**_Luxuriating Fey_**. Hverhuldras are not stodgy protectors of their homes. They enjoy the feeling of warmth they experience and believe others should be able to revel in it as well. Provided no violence occurs, hverhuldras are gracious hosts to their hot springs. Some may even encourage visitors to engage in dalliances underwater, using their magic to accommodate those unable to breathe underwater.

**_Inured to Cold_**. Despite their preference for warm or hot water, hverhuldras are hardened against cold weather. Their bodies generate incredible heat, and they produce copious amounts of steam when they stand in the cold.
