## Description
---
_These stooped creatures resemble elderly humans with cranberryâ€‘colored skin and bright, glowing eyes. They dress in loosely-woven clothing made from hay and foul leather strips._

**_Bargainers_**. Gumienniki strike fiendish bargains with willing farmers. They offer to protect silos and storehouses from vermin, thieves, and fire in return for a steady supply of livestock. Most of these bargains end poorly for the farmer, who soon discovers that the gumienniki doesn't discriminate when it's hungry.


**_Slip in by Moonlight_**. The gumienniki travel from the Lower Planes to the Material Plane whenever the moon is full. They delight in sacrificing captured humanoids or livestock in starlight, and the harvest moon is of particular importance to them. During the harvest moon, gumienniki are said to sprout flaming wings, which allow them to fly.


**_Servants of the Harvest_**. The gumienniki sometimes ally themselves with dark fertility cults in hidden groves, bringing blood sacrifices directly from their protected farmers to an altar. The farmers themselves may eventually be brought into the cult. The gumienniki may ally with a pack of [[roggenwolf]] or [[Rattok \|rattok demons]] to starve entire villages. In a few cases, they become servants to vampires, spying on a village in their cat form and reporting any effort to resist the vampire's rule.
