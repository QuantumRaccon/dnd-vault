## Description
---
_Bits and pieces of ground-up flesh and bone given unholy life shuffles forward, eager to feed._

Gorelings are a necromancer's answer when there just isn't enough flesh around to create a full zombie. During a fight, a chopped off appendage or two can be converted into a handy minion.

**_Torturous Hunger_**. It is said that within each goreling is a fragment of the dead creature's soul. It seeks out the flesh of living things, desperately trying to make itself whole again.


**_Leftover Parts_**. Gorelings come in a variety of shapes and sizes, since they are made of whatever is lying around, including whole eyes, ears, fingers, and organs. The sight of one is unsettling, often even for a necromancer.


**_Cannibal Tendencies_**. If no living flesh is available for a goreling to consume, it will cannibalize another goreling. Specimens become larger and larger as they absorb more and more flesh. Thankfully, most decay away to nothing before they get to be too big, but a massive goreling has been mistaken for a flesh golem more than once.


**_Undead Nature_**. The goreling doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
