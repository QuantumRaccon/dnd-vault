## Description
---
_Wearing short pants and a colorful turban, this monkey-like creature howls a warning, its tan fur bristling._

Quick and agile, vanara's long arms and prehensile tails are quite adept at many tasks. Their bodies are covered in fur, usually brown or black, but sometimes grey, white, or auburn. While they do bundle up in colder climates, most vanaras dress only in short pants or waist wraps and a colorful or plain white turban.

**_Efficient and Supportive_**. Vanaras are a contemplative race that dwells in forests or along coastlines. They live in tribes or clans, which are self-sufficient and have little need for trade with cities. They are quite helpful to outsiders that seek assistance, however, for they believe that good deeds towards others will be returned.

**_Sentinels of the Forest_**. Unlike their restless kapi cousins, vanaras are content with life in the forest and feel it is their duty to protect it. They communicate via rich, sonorous songs that can be heard for miles, warning those of ill intent not to tread in areas under their protection.

**_Deeply Spiritual_**. Many vanaras spend hours meditating on topics that face their tribes or lands, seeking guidance from higher powers. They regularly gather to sing in deep, booming harmony in their own form of prayer to such higher powers.
