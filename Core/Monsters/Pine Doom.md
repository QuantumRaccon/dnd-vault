## Description
---
>A living pine tree festooned with pinecones featuring razor-sharp edges looks balefully at the intrusion upon its solitude.

**_Gruff Forest Protector_**. Pine dooms are typically the largest plants in their groves, towering over ordinary pine trees. They see themselves as responsible for the well-being of their forests. They manage the growth of trees under their protection, clear out underbrush, and kill destructive vermin, allowing their groves to prosper. They have an inborn distrust of humanoids, but if a creature entering their forests seems genuinely in trouble, pine dooms allow them to seek shelter. They retaliate strongly, however, if someone takes advantage of their charity.

**_Mobile Groves_**. Similar to [[treant \|treants]], pine dooms can animate trees, though they do so only to relocate threatened groves. Unlike treants, pine dooms can animate all trees in a single grove, but the trees can't attack.

**_Powerful Pine Sap_**. A pine doom reserves its sap until it must attack intruders. The sap adheres to anything, allowing the pine doom to entrap weapons and particularly troublesome foes. Druids on friendly terms with the pine doom can coax the tree into producing sap for the druid to use in defending their own groves.
