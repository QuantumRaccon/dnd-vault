## Description
---
_As the hunter leveled his crossbow at the old silverback gorilla, a blur crossed his vision. An enormous monkey swung past him, striking him in the head with a ringed staff. The monkey's grin seemed both playful and terrifying._

**_Origin of the Monkey King_**. The gods once saw the most gifted, powerful monkey ever born, and they invited him to perform for them. The monkey, being curious, found the Peaches of Immortality, and he ate as many of them as he could find. The magical fruit gave him extraordinary powers, transforming him into the Monkey King.

**_Master of the Simians_**. When the forces of civilization encroached on the lands of the simians, the Monkey King led his army of apes and monkeys against the hostile incursion of hunters and explorers. To this day, when his kind is threatened, the Monkey King appears to fight off the intruders.

**_Wise Teacher_**. The Monkey King is sought by students hoping to learn the ways of his kind. The mix of wisdom and action, of great physical ability and great peace, is passed from the Monkey King to those worthy of his teachings.
