## Description
---
_The halberd-wielding soldier is made of brass and iron and stands head-and-shoulders taller than any human soldier. Steam hisses from valves at its joints, and its face is an iron mask of sharp angles and intimidating steel teeth._

**_Mighty but Linear_**. Clockwork soldiers are shock troops deployed by some human and dwarven societies. These soldiers can strike hard and quickly but are poorly armored and susceptible to burning out their internal furnace. Their rudimentary mechanical minds are sufficient for front-line fodder but wholly unsuited for more fluid situationsâ€”in these cases they require orders from living officers.
