## Description
---
_This creature resembles a blue-skinned dwarven infant, no older than a year. Its limbs flail and its head lolls with an obvious lack of coordination, and it screams incessantly._

Of the madness and insanity that resonates so strongly in derro society, perhaps none is so twisted as these premature infants, born insane and destined to lead their people further into madness. These derro are known as fetal savants.

**_Soul Swapping_**. Only the rarest of derro are born with the ability to exchange souls with other creatures, and when discovered, the babbling infants are treated with maddened reverence.

**_Carried into Battle_**. Placed in small, intricately wrought pillowed cages and borne aloft on hooked golden staves, the wild-eyed newborns are used to sow madness and confusion among enemy ranks.

**_Fear the Sun_**. Fetal savants hate and fear all bright lights.
