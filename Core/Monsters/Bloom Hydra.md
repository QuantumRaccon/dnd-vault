## Description
---
>A writhing bundle of vines takes the rough shape of a cat with the head of a lizard. Flower buds peak out of empty eye sockets, and wilted petals sprout along its ever-shifting hide.

The bloom hydra hunts deep within the jungles of the world. It prowls in the trees for prey on the jungle floor. When prey is in range, the bloom hydra uses its vines to pull its prey into the tree canopy where it can be consumed.
**_Magical Bloom_**. Bloom hydras typically have four flower-tipped, vine-like appendages, which regrow shortly after being severed. The vines are each capped with one magical flower: azalea, dahlia, daisy, or marigold. When the severed vines regrow, they sometimes sprout the rare hydra lily instead of their usual flower.

**_Hydra Harvest_**. Years ago, bloom hydras were common predators in the jungle, but a rumor spread that the hydra lily could grant eternal life. Subsequently, many great expeditions were mounted into the jungle by kings, peasants, and adventurers alike. On the brink of extinction, the hydras now live in the deepest jungles far from civilization.
