## Description
---
>Resembling a giant scaled stoat with savage tusks jutting from the corners of its mouth, this monster bears a set of diaphanous, moth-like wings that radiate all the colors of the spectrum.

**_Eaters of Magical Energy_**. The werynax is a fearsome predator that supplements its diet with magical energy from the natural world, occasionally disrupting plant growth rates, water cycles, and weather patterns. Fortunately, werynax are solitary creatures, though female werynax are fiercely protective of their young and may have a litter of up to a dozen offspring. Most werynax live in forests and grasslands.

**_Strange Habits_**. Why and how werynax feed on the magical energy of the natural world has baffled sages and scholars throughout the centuries, though it is clear that the energy werynax consume grants them their magical abilities. Some sages point to magical experimentation on the part of an insane lich or fey lord, while others lay the blame at the feet of the gods, believing the werynax to be some form of divine punishment for misusing the land. Many druids, however, speculate the werynax is an integral part of the natural orderâ€”just as death and decay are part of the life cycle, so too is the werynax part of the land's natural cycle.


> [!INFO] Werynax in Midgard
>In Midgard, the werynax feeds by siphoning energy that spills from ley lines and draining their power. When large groups of werynax gather, such as during mating season, their feeding temporarily shuts down most ley lines and has been observed to even briefly disrupt titanic ley lines. Because of this, werynax are detested by those who regularly use ley lines, and werynax are hunted by fey knights, ley line wizards, and many others.
