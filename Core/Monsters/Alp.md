## Description
---
_A tiny, hirsute, unpleasant-looking little man squats here, wearing a burlap tunic and a tiny white cap. Bloodshot eyes beneath bushy brows take in the surroundings with a contemptuous sneer._

**_Bringer of Nightmares_**. Believed to be the horrid result of a childbirth in which traditions were flouted, an alp lives to torment anyone it can. It takes particular delight in turning the dreams of sleeping victims into bloodcurdling nightmares as it watches them toss and turn, leering from the edge of the bed. The alp uses its abilities to paralyze its victims as they wake, sitting atop them and forcing them to lie there in utter terror, unable to move or to scream for help before it vanishes.
**_Farmer's Bane_**. When not otherwise occupying itself with tormenting the unconscious, an alp gets up to all sorts of evil throughout the night, from draining the cows dry of milk, to returning soiled diapers to infants, to smothering chickens.
**_Hides in Plain Sight_**. Whenever people are about, the alp changes its form to that of a small farm creature. However, the tiny white cap which allows the alp to become invisible doesn't change with it, and so the alp tries to restrict itself to the forms of farm animals which are white in color. On occasion, though, in the excitement of the moment, the alp forgets.
