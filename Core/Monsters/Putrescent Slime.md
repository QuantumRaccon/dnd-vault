## Description
---
>As a rat moves to an algae-filled pool of water to take a drink, the pool suddenly comes to life and devours the rat.

Putrescent slimes form in large pools of fetid water and are often mistaken for algae by neophyte explorers in the depths of the world.
**_Pool Feeders_**. Putrescent slimes lurk in dank pools, only attacking desperate creatures that drink from their homes. As their prey decomposes in the water, the putrescent slime slowly digests the disgusting morass.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A putrescent slime doesn't require sleep.
