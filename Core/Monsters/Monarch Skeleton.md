## Description
---
_An undead monarch, tight white skin clinging to its skeletal visage and a crooked oversized crown dangling precariously from the top of its skull, stares with glee at the coming battle._

**_Undead King_**. Necromantic energy seeps from the monarch and warps the reality of the mortal world it corrupts. It brings all that appear before it to their knees in reverence. A powerful arcane necromancer could discover and unlock the ability to command armies of undead with the remains of a monarch skeleton, but such research risks madness.

**_Dread Blade_**. The blade the monarch wields is a powerful and cursed weapon when in the hands of the monarch. Infused with corruption, it slices through what remains of a mortal coil

**_Ghostly Minions_**. The monarch skeleton can call upon the greatest warriors who have fallen before to rise and hold its enemies at bay. The monarch is often accompanied by a royal guard of skeletons eager to defend their sovereign.

**_Undead Nature_**. The monarch skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
