## Description
---
>A feminine creature made of decaying, thorny plant life gives a wicked laugh as she touches a tree and disappears. Moments later, the tree emits the same laugh as it swings its branches.

**_Formed by Hags_**. [[night hag \|Night hags]] create tree skinners by taking advantage of [[dryad \|dryads]] that have been driven mad by the death of their trees. The hags promise the dryads a chance to connect with trees again and induce them into submitting to a special ritual. The ritual used to transform a dryad into a skinner also instills in the dryad a hatred of all fey. The irony of a former dryad using trees to murder fey creatures delights the hags to no end.

**_Tree Puppeteers_**. Tree skinners can inhabit trees, turning the plants into weapons that can destroy forest communities. The evil essence of a skinner slowly rots a tree from the inside out, eventually killing the plant. When the tree dies, the skinner is expelled and becomes agitated until she finds a new tree to inhabit.

**_Skinner Bands_**. Tree skinners all share the same desireâ€”the destruction of all fey creatures. When the skinners encounter others of their kind, they join forces to attack communities of fey. As long as they have fey to attack, the group will stay together indefinitely, otherwise the lack of a common enemy causes infighting, leading to the dissolution of the group.

**_Hated by Treants_**. [[treant \|Treants]] abhor tree skinners, seeing them as abominations that manipulate plants and sap the life of trees. If a treant hears of skinner activity, it stops at nothing to slay the fiend.
