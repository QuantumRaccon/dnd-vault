## Description
---
When nascent acolytes seek to make contact with beings beyond the stars, they are often compelled to make an offering. By sacrificing powerful creatures, those elder forces gain vessels they can corrupt for their own ends and use to enter the Material Plane in physical form. Unfortunately for those forces beyond the stars, the most powerful creature available for such timid and young acolytes to sacrifice is often the humble cow.

**_Uncanny Beasts_**. The terrifying aurochon is a creature of cold and shadow, clinging to the corrupted flesh of a bovine sacrifice. The hulking thing strides on four massive, hooved legs but bears little else in common with its ancestor. Darkness clings to the beast and a long row of tentacles erupt from along the spine, gyrating with malice. Hearts seize up as a deep thrum blares out from the aurochon's shrouded face, spraying its enemies with shards of ice.
**_Signs of Corruption_**. Like their creators, aurochons are initially found in urban and rural locations. After arriving on the Material Plane, an aurochon searches for a dark lair, often in a cave or sewer, but never far from the cult's base.
