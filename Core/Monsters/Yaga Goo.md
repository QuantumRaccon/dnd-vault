## Description
---
_A bubbling pool of green and brown goo shifts to a vaguely humanoid shape._

**_Simmered Down_**. Adventurers who meet Baba Yaga and offend her are usually boiled down and turned into Yaga goo, an oozing, loyal spy. The recipe also exists outside of Baba Yaga's cauldronsâ€”some hags and ancient witches know how to turn foes into Yaga goo.

**_Scent of Stew_**. Yaga goo is said to smell rather appetizing, a bit like pork or a hearty mutton stew. This scent is difficult to distinguish from actual stew, so Yaga goo is known to do some of its spying for Baba Yaga in actual kitchens and cauldrons.

**_Ooze Nature_**. The Yaga goo doesn't require sleep.

>While many gnomes live free of the influence of Baba Yaga, some have not been so smart or lucky. The gnomes of Niemheim live with the daily fear of the Old Grandmother. Some poor fools tried to return to Baba Yaga, seeking to bargain, wheedle, and plead to sate her wrath. Fearful whispers describe how they were boiled down into wretched goo. This goo serves as a spy for Baba Yaga's minions and often terrorizes gnomes that might once have been family.
