## Description
---
_Swift and lightly armored, the elite are archers, miners, and trap‑makers—educated and quicker than most of their fellow tribesmen._

**_Educated Mine Bosses_**. Elite kobolds are generally the claws of the king, literate, able to work out sums, keen-eyed with a sling stone, and (most of all) loyal to their tribe more than to their clutchmates. [[King Kobold \|King kobolds]] take advantage of their loyalty and put them in charge of planning raids as sergeants and junior chieftains or keeping other kobolds working in the mines.

**_Quick Troops_**. In war, elite kobolds fill the roles of slingers, engineers, and massed light infantry. They fight with great devotion, though often with little effect except through weight of numbers or the occasional notable success at undermining enemy walls.
