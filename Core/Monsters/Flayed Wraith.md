## Description
---
>This flying creature looks like the disembodied skin of a once-living person. Its mouth is twisted into a tortured scream, and its eyes gleam a baleful blue.

**_Tortured to Death_**. Flayed wraiths come into being when certain dark energies are present at the moment when an individual is tortured to death. Unlike typical wraiths, they retain the skin they wore in life. Often, the various forms of torture used against them are still evident on the canvas of their bodies.

**_Mad_**. The flayed wraith is in a perpetual state of madness, reliving the days and moments that led to its demise. Flayed wraiths constantly feel the slice of the blade through their skin, the pain of blunt trauma to fingers and toes, or other objects being used on their bodies for the sheer purpose of causing agony. In death, they now seek to cause this same pain to others. They often keep their victims alive to inflict the unspeakable things that were once done to them upon the living. They desire to bring the same pain to others that was once so mercilessly brought against them, and in so doing, at least in their twisted minds, become the masters of life and death.

**_Undead Nature_**. A flayed wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
