## Description

>An impossibly black pool of goo undulates forward seeming to pull everything around it into its endless depths.

**_Aspect of the Void_**. Some speculate that voidpools are intrusions of the Void itself into the Material Plane. These blots on the surface of the world mindlessly seek to draw everything into the Void through the portal they carry at their cores.

**_Willing Travelers_**. The most daring, and prepared, of adventurers actually seek out voidpools to facilitate passage to the Void. Not resisting the voidpool's influence allows these brave or foolhardy individuals to minimize the damage they incur enroute to the outer plane.

**_Ooze Nature_**. The voidpool doesn't require sleep.
