## Description
---
>A grey humanoid wearing a dark tattered cloak and worn armor descends on glimmering, mothlike wings. In its hands it wields a halberd tipped with a cold light. Its black lidless eyes are filled with envy and sorrow.

**_Condemned to the Dark_**. Lunarians are a race of mothlike fey originally from the moon. However, after attempting to take the moon's power for themselves, they were cast out by a fey lord and damned to the depths of the world, never to see their lunar home again.

**_Angels of the Underworld_**. Stories tell of lunarians helping people far below the surface, striking down monsters at the last moment. However, they never do so for free, often demanding valuable trinkets from the surface as payment for their services. If those they rescue deny them a reward or give them a bad one, they are prone to attack.


> [!INFO] Curse: Minor Surface Curse
>A creature cursed with a minor surface curse feels pain when exposed to natural light. While cursed and in sunlight or moonlight, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom ([[Perception]]) checks. The curse ends if the affected creature completes a long rest in darkness. Alternatively, the curse can be lifted early by a [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.
> [!INFO] Lunarians in Midgard
>In Midgard, lunarians are hunted by the [[lunar devil \|lunar devils]] (Tome of Beasts) of the [[Moonlit King]] (Tome of Beasts) . The ephemeral fey lord takes great offense at the creatures' existence and considers them a threat to the Moon Tower and what power remains there. Should mortals wish to gain favor with the Moonlit King, the pale wings of the lunarian make a fitting gift.
