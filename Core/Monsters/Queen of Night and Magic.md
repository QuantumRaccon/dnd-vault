## Description
---
A fey lady of stunning beauty with hair the color of midnight stands before a shining field of stars. A gown seemingly woven from the night sky drapes her flawless ivory skin. Bright lights glitter like diamonds in her crown and raiment, and some drift about her body and dance near her hand.

Her Celestial and Royal Majesty, Sarastra Aestruum, Queen of Night and Magic, is also Duchess of the Heavens, Countess of Thorn, Mistress of Air and Darkness, Lady of the Summer Palace, and Bride of Shadows. The Queen rules the Court of the shadow fey with grace and majesty—most of the time. Queen Sarastra is the head of the Summer court, which rules the shadow fey in its season. On the rare occasion when the courtly season turns, Sarastra steps aside in favor of her husband and rival, the Moonlit King.

**_Shadow Sorceress_**. The Queen of Night and Magic does not bear her moniker lightly. She is a devastatingly potent sorceress, augmented with command over the stuff of shadows. Though her nature is undeniably dark, Queen Sarastra is hardly unreasonable. She is quick to recognize the value in any supplicant, mortal or fey, who manages to catch her royal eye. She is never one to ignore an opportunity to further her agenda or to gain further power over the Moonlit King.


**_Fey Lords and Ladies_**. Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings, but despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.
**_Heads of State_**. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's rule, in his or eyes, a fey ruler's word is law, and so shall the rest of the world see it! Outsiders may not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

**_Circles of Power_**. Each fey noble is supreme in his or her own bailiwick, and the rulers maintain a rigid hierarchy among themselves. Thee Queen of Night and Magic is undeniably the most powerful of all fey nobles, and she rules cyclically with her embittered husband, the Moonlit King. Together, the Summer and Winter monarchs rule over the entire shadow fey race. Thee River King is next in power, and he rules over the river elves of the Arbonesse forest. Thee Snow Queen rules among the ice, snow, and plundering reavers of the far north, as wells as commanding the obedience of the [[fraughashar]] and [[ice maiden \|ice maidens]]. The Bear King, the weakest politically, rules a northerly city-state where [[werebear \|werebears]] are common and mead flows like water.
Thee odd man out is the Lord of the Hunt. Though he is associated with both the shadow fey and the light elves, no one is certain of his true identity or how he fits into the political structure of fey nobility. Because he seldom concerns himself with politics, few have felt any need to press the question.
Other fey courts and rulers certainly exist, though their rulers are more esoteric than those described here.

**_Vacant Thrones_**. When a lord or lady dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the station of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.


> [!INFO] Touch of Iron
>Lords and ladies of the fey courts are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats. A universal exception to this is weapons of cold-wrought iron. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh. A cold iron weapon is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies.
>Cold iron weapons, however, are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficult—and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.

**_Queen of Night and Magic's Lair_**. Queen Sarastra makes her home in the Shadow Realm (plane of shadows), in the ancient halls of the Courts of the Shadow Fey. A great castle of delicate spires and graceful bridges, the Courts of the Shadow Fey contain the Royal Halls, the Queen's abode proper, and the Winter Palace, the home of her husband (when he's present).
When the Summer Court holds sway and the Queen of Night and Magic rules, her lair is all of the Courts of the Shadow Fey, with the exception of the Winter Palace. When the Winter Court rules, the Queen's lair is confined to the Royal Halls.
