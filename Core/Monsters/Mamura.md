## Description
---
_This tiny monstrosity combines the worst elements of a dead frog and a rotting fish. Its slimy, scaly, vaguely humanoid form has three clawed arms arranged radially about its body. Its slimy green bat.like wings seem too small to work, yet it flies very well._

**_Twisted Field Sprites_**. Mamuras are the twisted faeries of magical wastelands and barren plains. They were once goodaligned, pixie-like fey called "polevoi," or "field sprites," but at some point they swore their souls to a dark goddess and were corrupted by her foul magic. Now they are twisted, alien things.

**_Cross-Dimensional_**. The mamura is one degree out of phase with the usual five dimensions. As a result, it always appears blurry and indistinct even in bright light, and it seems translucent in dim light.
Mamuras babble constantly, but their talk is mostly nonsense. Their minds operate in multiple dimensions in time as well as space, and this allows them to talk to creatures of the Realms Beyond. Because of this, their babble may be prophetic, but only few can decipher it.

**_Prophetic Followers_**. They occasionally align themselves with powerful goblin tribes or evil wasteland sorcerers for their own unknowable purposes.

> [!INFO] Mamuras in Midgard
>The mamura are servants of the Black Goat of the Woods, and they live in the Wasted West and various fetid swamps and badlands. They seem friendly with the selang, and they arrange strange and orgiastic rites with them at the equinoxes.
