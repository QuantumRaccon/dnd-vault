## Description
---


Some adult frost giants are skilled hunters who construct and hurl nets weighted down with fragments of metal or bone. This ability is represented by the following action option.

**_Weighted Net_**.  **5** to hit, ranged 20/60 ft., one Small, Medium, or Large creature. {@h}The target is [[restrained]] until it escapes the net. Any creature can use its action to make a DC 17 Strength check to free itself or another creature in the net, ending the effect on a success. Dealing 15 slashing damage to the net (AC 12) destroys the net and frees the target.
