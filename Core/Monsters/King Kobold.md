## Description
---
_Wrapped in tattered finery and draped in silver and gold jewelry, the king kobold sits on a throne, surrounded by an assortment of grisly traps and weaponry. Its crown, a garish mass of precious metals, adds weight to its boastful decrees._

**_Keen Nose for Politics_**. With considerable guile won by hard experience, a king kobold excels at subterfuge, sustains lucrative trade, and hones a keen eye for potential treachery. The king who rules for more than a few seasons has mastered the art of keeping itself safe through a combination of warriors paid well enough to be loyal, a constant campaign to root out enemies, and an abundance of traps, tricks, and contingencies should things go sour. However, security from threats above and below ground and wealth earned through trade are what truly maintain a king on its throne.

**_Eyes Everywhere_**. The condition of its warrens and outlying tribes that pay tribute occupy much of a king kobold's time and energy. Tunnel-runners come and go in a constant stream from warren to warren to keep the king abreast of happenings in all of its holdings. A truly successful king may command fealty from a network of tribes stretching for miles.

**_Long Live the King_**. Unlike many tribal kobold chieftains, a king kobold leaves the fighting to its underlings whenever possible, except when doing so might weaken its hold on its territory. Few creatures are as ruthless as a threatened king, and the king will not hesitate to sacrifice everything and everyone to escape and live to fight another day.
