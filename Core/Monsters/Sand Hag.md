## Description
---
_This withered crone glares malevolently, her face framed by lank gray hair. Her malicious grin is filled with shark teeth, and drool trickles from her lips._

**_Hatred of Beauty_**. Sand hags are terrifying crones that haunt desert ruins and forgotten oases. Their hatred for things of beauty and peace is terrible to behold. A sand hag uses her illusions and mimicry to lure travelers into an ambush.

**_False Oasis_**. They delight in tricking a caravan into an illusory oasis, killing all the riding animals and pack animals so the travelers can't flee, and then terrifying and slaughtering them one by one.

**_Drain Bodies_**. For the slaughter of animals or humanoids, a sand hag prefers to rely on her claws, which drain the moisture from their victims. They leave the mummified remnants in postures of life—tied to a saddle, or atop a guard tower—to terrify others.
Sand hags stand 6 to 7 feet tall, weigh less than 150 lb., and dress in torn and tattered robes. Although skeletally thin, a sand hag's apparent frailty belies her prodigious strength.
