## Description
---
>This tall, muscular humanoid has bronze skin and the wings of a hawk. Its head is that of a majestic hunting hound with the teeth and reddish-gold mane of a lion, and it holds a flaming mace in its hands.

**_Bastard Sons of Chaos_**. The first uridimmus were the illegitimate offspring of a demon lord and an unknown entity of chaos and were soundly defeated by a powerful deity of law. After their defeat, the uridimmus chose to serve the god as guardians of the heavenly realm. The tainted origin of uridimmus manifests in the chaotic mass of fire, lightning, and radiance that clings to the heads of their maces.

**_Tainted Servants of Law_**. Uridimmus are tireless guardians, and most are tasked with guarding the portals into the lawful planes. Some also serve the deities directly as bodyguards or lead groups of lesser celestials in battle. While uridimmus are unwavering and steadfast guardians, they are also completely merciless in combat and not above making examples out of trespassers. This tendency sometimes causes friction between the uridimmu and other angels, like [[planetar \|planetars]], who claim that the souls of uridimmus are still tainted with evil.

**_Immortal Nature_**. An uridimmu doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
