## Description
---
Favoring linen robes of crimson or black to hide the stains and spatters of its medium, a blood mage about its work might look like a beggar and smell like an abattoir, but the power coursing through its veins makes such concerns beneath the blood mage's notice. Drawing power from bloodletting, both its own and that of others, makes most civilizations fear and despise the blood mage, necessitating that it practice its dark arts in secret. Each period of renewed study is usually accompanied by disappearances among the most vulnerable. A trail of exsanguinated corpses follows.
