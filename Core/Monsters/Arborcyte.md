## Description
---
_A mound of thorn-covered vines writhes into motion, rearing up to reveal an assemblage of bleached bones at its core. A hellish light gleams from the empty sockets of its many skulls._

Though druids do not suffer twisted, unnatural things to survive in the wild, sometimes, in a cruel twist of fate, they become the very thing they abhor.
**_Seed of Desecration_**. An arborcyte is the corrupted soul of a druid slain in the failed defense of its woodland home. A mass of vines crawl to the dying druid to serve as a vessel into the afterlife. The druid's soul is then twisted by forces of desecration, and what arises is a shambling monstrosity consumed by the desire to destroy any life that enters its blighted glade.
**_Skeletal Remains_**. Those slain by an arborcyte are eventually stripped of flesh and other organic materials by the acidic sap oozing from its many tendrils. Those bones not left to litter the forest floor work their way into the arborcyte's core, joining the remnants of other victims and the slain druid in a verdant ossuary.
**_Insidious Destruction_**. An arbocyte becomes deadlier when it is attacked. As its vines are hacked apart, each of the thorny tendrils rises up to fight alongside the main mass of the creature, creating an undulating dance of death threatening anyone foolish enough to remain in proximity.
