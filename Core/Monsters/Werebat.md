## Description
---
_A lean, muscled humanoid covered in short, velvet-like fur crouches on the rooftop, its long, membranous wings drooping to the ground like the sleeves of a long robe. Its face bears little trace of anything humanoid with large, pointed ears, needle-like teeth, black eyes, flaring nostrils, and dark fur._

**_Night Hunters_**. Werebats hunt by night, swooping down from the darkness on unsuspecting prey and leaving mutilated corpses behind, often partially exsanguinated. When hunting, a werebat often takes on the form of a hideous, human-sized bat with a wingspan the length of a horse.

**_Idolatry or Isolation_**. In cultures that worship bat deities, werebats are often seen as holy creatures. They may occupy clerical roles in such societies, though their tendency toward malevolence drives them to use such positions to seek greater power. Werebats living in less convenient circumstances seek out isolated lairs overlooking remote settlements, moving frequently when their gory presence draws too much attention.
Regardless of their circumstances, werebats usually have a swarm of bats at their command.

**_Telltale Features_**. Werebats in their humanoid form often display bat-like features; a flattened or upturned nose, tufts of dark hair topping pointed ears, or sharp teeth are common.
