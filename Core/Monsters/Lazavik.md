>Standing no taller than a cat, this tiny humanoid has a snow-white beard and a single eye that blazes with golden light. He holds a long reed whip in his hands.

**_Swamp-Dwelling Fey_**. Lazaviks are fey that dwell primarily in swamps and marshes, picking particular tracts of marshland to call home. When it has chosen a suitable location, a lazavik builds a minuscule hut for itself out of dried rushes, mud, and sticks, and it spends its days fishing and enjoying the company of the native animals and good-aligned fey of the region. All lazaviks are male and are thought to sprout like reeds out of the damp soil, though romances between female [[korrigan \|korrigans]] (Creature Codex) and lazaviks are not uncommon and sometimes produce offspring.

**_Glowing Guides_**. Lazaviks hate seeing anyone in distress and use the animals of the region to keep tabs on creatures in peril from natural swamp hazards or evil monsters. When it finds creatures in danger, a lazavik uses its glowing eye to direct them to safety or prevent them from getting lost, but it prefers to keep itself out of sight as much as possible. Lazaviks hate evil swamp-dwelling monsters like [[green hag \|green hags]] and [[miremal \|miremals]] (Tome of Beasts), but they save their greatest enmity for [[will-o'-wisp \|will-o'-wisps]]. They are often confused with will-o'-wisps, which leads to complications in their otherwise peaceful existences.
