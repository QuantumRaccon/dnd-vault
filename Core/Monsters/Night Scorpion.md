## Description
---
_These midnight-black scorpions have a bright-red stripe on their tails, signaling the crippling poison within._

**_Blinding Poison_**. This aptly named arachnid hunter blinds victims with a dose of its crippling poison. It feeds on whole camels when given the chance, but it more commonly devours goats, sheep, and people. It hunts by night, when its blindvision is most effective.

**_Underdark Giants_**. The species is common in deep caves and underworld realms. They are eight feet long with a seven-foot tail and daggerlike stinger. They weigh up to 200 pounds.

**_Valuable Venom_**. Night scorpion venom is highly prized and can command upwards of 400 gp per dose.
