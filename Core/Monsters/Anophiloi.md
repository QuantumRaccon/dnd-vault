## Description
---
_With a needle-like snout and a gut full of blood, the anophiloi are hard to miss. The buzz of the creature's wings haunts the jungles and marshes, sending warmâ€‘blooded creatures for cover._

**_Blood Drinkers_**. Predators of the swamplands, jungles, and other humid places, the anophiloi, intelligent mosquitoes the size of large dogs, feed mainly on livestock and large game animals. Their choice of food, however, is a pragmatic one and has nothing to do with morality; game animals won't organize to wipe them out, humanoids will. When famished, anything that bleeds becomes prey for the anophiloi.
**_Seasonal Menace_**. The anophiloi require heat and humidity to thrive. They spend the cold months of the year dwindling in size and dehydrating while hidden in hibernation after one last gluttonous feeding. By the end of this dormant period, the creatures resemble a bundle of gray and black sticks. As soon as the temperature increases, the anophiloi take to the air and seek out easy prey.
**_Barely Kept in Check_**. The anophiloi's period of dormancy allows farmers and keepers of livestock to keep the creature's population thin. At the first dip in temperature, hunts are organized. If not for the frenetic pace and frequency of their egg laying, the anophiloi would be an unpleasant memory in settled regions.
