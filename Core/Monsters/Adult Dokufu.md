## Description
---
The dokufu is a giant, monstrous, spiderlike creature that has been corrupted by taint. These beasts are hugely dangerous and create lairs that can test even the most proficient adventuring parties.

**_Magical Exoskeleton_**. A dokufu is covered with a heavy exoskeleton resembling the rocks of its mountain habitat, allowing it to blend in perfectly with its surroundings. It also has the ability to change the color of its exoskeleton to shades of white to blend in with snowy environments. Its exoskeleton provides the dokufu with ample protection against physical harm, as well as magical harm as the chitin thickens with age.
**_Extended Lifespan_**. It is unknown how long dokufu live but they can most certainly become several thousand years old. They mature and grow very slowly, becoming immensely large in old age. While a dokufu spiderling is no bigger than a small dog, they are about the size of a panther by the time they become younglings. Once they reach adulthood, they're about as large as a horse and truly ancient dokufu will grow to be the size of a mammoth.
**_Feared and Avoided_**. If it is discovered that an area is home to a young dokufu, a hunting party is quickly gathered to kill the creature before it matures. Areas that contain mature dokufu are usually avoided completely as many a great warrior has faced off against a dokufu, only to become fodder for its young. They are greatly feared throughout the world and even speaking their name inspires terror in children and adults alike.
**_Masters of Illusions_**. While they might resemble brutish creatures, dokufu are cunning and wise. They have the innate ability to create powerful illusions which they utilize to lure prey closer. Their magical prowess becomes more powerful as they mature. Once old enough, dokufu can even use the snow or stone beneath their feet as others would use a door, seemingly teleporting through the ground.
**_Tainted Nature_**. Dokufu eyes act as lenses, greatly increasing the potential of their illusory magics. This odd mutation is caused by the massive amount of taint within the creature, which has rendered their eyes useless for seeing but granted it an otherworldly sense for perceiving its surroundings. This fact isn't widely known, however, and more than one warrior has attempted to blind a dokufu adversary only to discover that it wasn't hindered by it in the least.
**_Dark Reproduction_**. Dokufu are androgynous. They reproduce by implanting eggs into humanoid bodies to provide food for their young. Deep within caves, they hang the hosts from the ceiling, often while still alive. Shortly before the egg hatches inside the host, the adult dokufu will swallow the host, so the egg can hatch inside its digestive tract.
**_A Dokufu's Lair_**. Unless traveling to another region which might provide better hunting grounds, a dokufu usually creates its lair within a cave. While in its lair, a dokufu has access to Lair Actions. An adult dokufu encountered in its lair has a challenge rating of 15 (13,000 XP).
**_Regional Effects_**. The region containing the dokufu's lair is warped by its powerful illusionary magic, though all of the effects feel real. Creatures with truesight can see through the illusions, however, all other elements of the illusion remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion's presence, the creature can still physically interact with the illusion. The dokufu itself is unaffected by all detrimental effects. The region contains the following effects:
Every so often an ice sculpture of a horrible spider-like monstrosity appears. A creature that sees such a sculpture must succeed a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or become frightened for 1 minute and gain the following flaw while in the region: __.
At the end of each of its turns while frightened, a creature must succeed another DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or take 9 (**2d8**) psychic damage. Randomly determine which creature a sculpture is visible to, as each sculpture is only visible to a single creature.

- Each creature must succeed a DC 10 Constitution saving throw at the end of each hour or gain one level of exhaustion. Creatures with resistance or immunity to cold damage automatically succeed on the saving throw, as do creatures wearing cold weather gear and creatures naturally adapted to cold climates.
The strong winds in the region carry with them snow and ice, thus imposing disadvantage on ranged weapon attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on hearing or sight. A creature can see no further than 10 feet in front of it and all terrain is difficult terrain.
Additionally, all open flames are extinguished, fogs are dispersed, and flying by nonmagical means is nearly impossible. A flying creature in the region must land at the end of its turn or fall.

- Dokufu tracks can be found in the snow. If a creature follows the tracks, it will walk in circles. A creature with truesight isn't fooled by this, and other creatures can discern the trickery with a successful DC 15 Wisdom (Survival) check after having completed the circle. At a regular pace, it takes between two and three hours to complete the circle once.


If the dokufo dies, these effects end immediately.
