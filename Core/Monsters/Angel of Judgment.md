## Description
---
>With faces of light and stern appraisal, these angels see both sides and render a verdict.

Angels of judgment are cosmic agents of balance. Unlike most angels, they exist to enforce equality between law and chaos. They prefer to solve disputes verbally but use force when prudent.
**_Two-Faced_**. Each angel of judgment bears two aspects: a dispassionate angel and a fiendish judge. When called to violence by the heavenly host or infernal legions, its dispassionate face changes to that of an avenging angel.

**_Witnesses to History_**. In times of turmoil and upheaval, angels of judgment watch over events. While observing, the angel is a stoic spectator, intervening only if it sees a threat to universal harmony. Even then, they prefer to send [[sammael \|sammael angels]] (Creature Codex) to carry out their judgments, taking direct action only against the direst of threats.

**_Cosmic Arbiters_**. Angels of judgment arbitrate claims between the lords of righteousness and the masters of madness. If either party violates the terms, the angel destroys the offender and patiently waits for a new representative to take their place. Immortal Nature. An angel of judgment doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
