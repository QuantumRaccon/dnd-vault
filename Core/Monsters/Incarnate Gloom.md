## Description
---
>This inky black cloud exudes a terrible chill and seems to tear at the soul, inducing a feeling of despondency and loneliness.

**_Despair Given Form_**. Incarnate glooms result when a group of at least a dozen people suffer from hopelessness and die without receiving any relief from the feeling. This collective negative emotion coalesces into a nebulous form that seeks out more despair.

**_Whispers in the Darkness_**. An incarnate gloom takes perverse pleasure in picking off members of a large group one at a time. It surrounds a chosen victim and telepathically imparts a sense of isolation on its quarry.

**_Will-o'-Wisp Symbiosis_**. Incarnate glooms work with [[will-o'-wisp \|will-o'-wisps]] to attract prey to the glooms' dark masses. Though incarnate glooms snuff out light in their vicinity, they allow the light produced by the smaller undead to shine, providing a false sense of security to potential victims.

**_Undead Nature_**. The incarnate gloom doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
