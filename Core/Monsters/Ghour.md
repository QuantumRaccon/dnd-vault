## Description
---
Baphomet: Demon Lord of Minotaurs and the Prince of Beasts. Worshipped by the beastial minotaurs, the ogres, and the giants. Baphomet commands an army of demonic minions from his Endless Maze within the 600th Layer of the Abyss. Three of these have served different purposes to Baphomet in his endless wars and each with their own unique abilities and characteristics.

These monstrous, ogre-sized demons appear similar to a minotaur, but have the ability to breath noxious gas, cast spells and roar loud enough to shatter a creatures psyche.

**_Baphomet's Commanders_**. The presence of a ghour on the Material Plane shows that the Demon Lord Baphomet is happy with his worshippers. These dominating fiends lead not only his humanoid cults, but also minotaurs, ogres and renegade giants who revere the Prince of Beasts. These rampaging demons are brutal leaders, driving their congregation to commit bestial acts.
**_Atrophying Breath_**. In combat, a ghour likes to open with a blast of its breath weapon. The suffocating gas this demon produces chokes the life from mortals and visibly saps their strength, leaving even the strongest of barbarians choking for breath. Often, this attack will be followed up with a deafening roar which clears a way for the charge of baphomet's cultists.
