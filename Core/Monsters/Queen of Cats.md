## Description
---
_The taller-than-average woman steps out of the shadows, her gown whispering. Her head is that of a sleek, black cat with gleaming, green eyes. The nails on her fingers and toes are long, curved, and sharp._

Khastiri is the Queen of Cats, the Shadow Guardian, and Herald of the Moon. She moves, often unseen, in all walks of mortal and fey life. Her true form is that of a statuesque woman nearly 10 feet tall with the head of a black cat. She prefers to move about at night under the moon. Her wanderings take her to places where danger and unsuspecting people are likely to cross paths, and her curious nature often leads her in unexpected directions. She carries the radiance and purity of moonlight into the dark, wielding it as a weapon as keen as her claws against her foes.
**_Protector in the Dark_**. Those who strike out in search of adventure learn quickly that the shadows and crevices of the world hide many dangers. Most people have no defense against the worst things that prowl the darkness, the things that slip into the world from the places beyond. The Queen of Cats and her followers stand in opposition to those dark influences. Through the ages, her midnight prowling in cat form, and subsequent battles with creatures from the outer darkness, have given rise to the folk tales of cats protecting their owners from evil spirits.

**_Diplomat and Spy_**. The Queen of Cats saunters through the world slipping from one stratum of society to another with grace and ease. Either as an unassuming black cat in back alleys or a woman of bearing regal enough to blend seamlessly in imperial courts, she finds forces of corruption and darkness wherever they lurk.
Befitting her fluid mobility through nearly any population, she often carries word from deities or powerful beings tied to the moon. Rumor holds that she is a confidant, or possibly a lover, of the the Moonlit King (Tome of Beasts, p. 190). The Queen of Cats is one of the few creatures who can slip through the twisted mazes surrounding his home. If his worsening madness is any concern to her, she doesn't show it.


**_The Queen of Cats' Lair_**. The Queen of Cats lives in a luxurious extra dimensional palace called Bubastal. The entrance to the palace is difficult to find, often hidden in alleys, sewer entrances, or normally-empty alcoves between buildings. The only constant is the doorway is always in a city. The palace itself is full of carpets and soft furniture, cushions, and many potted plants. The air smells of fragrant herbs, particularly catnip, and incense. Small platforms, steps, and walkways make the entire palace an inquisitive cat's paradise, and all the d√©cor features tassels and other dangling adornments.
**_Animal Lords_**. While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in celestial councils. The [[Queen of Serpents]] speaks to the gods of the desert, and the [[Queen of Birds]] holds a wide swath of territory with eyes drifting gently on updrafts throughout the world. Each animal lord sees and communicates with the members of its species in some mysterious and unknowable fashion. News from the granaries and the kitchens always finds its way to the [[Mouse King \|Mouse King's]] ears, and news from fields of battle or of wheat inevitably lands in the remote nest of the [[Lord of Vultures]].
What do the animal lords do with their legions and their vast array of information? Some sages believe they trade this to other figures, demon and angel alike, in exchange for favors understood best as celestial currency. Others say that they merely inform their followers of dangers to avoid, rich prey to hunt, or similar concerns. In many cases, the animal lords find they have both the time and inclination to meddle occasionally in the affairs of humanoids, especially those who are particularly kind or unusually cruel to their followers.
As a group, the animal lords look after their own, and they defend their territory and their wellsprings of power against humanoid encroachment. The great argument among the animal lords themselves is whether to align themselves with the humanoid world (as the [[Queen of Cats]] and, to some degree, the [[Mouse King]] have done) or to remain outside of it (as the others have).
