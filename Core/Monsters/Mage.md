## Description

Any spellcaster that can cast the [[find familiar]] spell (such as an archmage or mage) is likely to have a familiar. The familiar can be one of the creatures described in the spell (see the Player's Handbook) or some other Tiny monster, such as a [[crawling claw]], [[imp]], [[pseudodragon]], or [[quasit]].
