## Description
---
A large gremlin rises from a hollowed-out barrel throne and belches loudly, wielding a wood spigot tap as a scepter in one hand and a broken bottle in the other.
**_Drunken Kings_**. Rum lords attract other [[rum gremlin \|rum gremlins]] (Tome of Beasts) into a court of drunken debauchery. Rum lords are known for entertaining guests of some notoriety within the darker circles of society, especially [[wererat \|wererats]] and [[ratfolk]] (Tome of Beasts). Like all rum gremlins, the rum lord loves alcohol, and wise petitioners bring rare and exotic alcohol to the lord before asking for aid.

**_Rival Drinkers_**. Rum lords have a special hatred for creatures that take up residence in taverns and alehouses in their territory, especially [[clurichaun \|clurichauns]] (Tome of Beasts), [[alehouse drake \|alehouse drakes]] (Tome of Beasts), and other rum lords.

**_Tougher Than the Rest_**. Stronger than their kin in body and mind, rum lords aren't bothered by bells like rum gremlins. In spite of this, rum lords aren't overly cruel to their minions and often go out of their way to remove bells from their territory. This kindness doesn't extend to disobedient rum gremlins, and a rum lord always keeps one bell tucked away, just in case.
