## Description
---
_Covered with dark green bark and twining tendrils, this longlimbed humanoid exudes a palpable aura of horror._

**_Melding of Flesh and Vine_**. Vine lords are formed from the union of full-grown tendril puppets and the force-grown descendants of plantfolk. Their servants include most plant species, including tendril puppets and vine troll skeletons.

**_Walking Forests_**. Vine lords seek to expand and empower forests and jungles in the service of their patron gods and demons, or simply to expand their own power. In many cases, they compel trees to walk into grasslands or plowed fields on moonless nights, claiming that territory for the trees.

> [!INFO] Vine Lords in Midgard
>Vine lords owe much of their parentage to the Kijani, the original inhabitants of Kush. They are agents of the Green Walker, working to spread the Living Jungle beyond its current borders. Vine lords marshal jungle denizens to fight for them as tendril puppets, and they often entice druid circles with promises of great power.
