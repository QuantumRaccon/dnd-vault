## Description
---
Howler baboons are territorial primates that claim stretches of forest and hills in large troops. Their presence is usually heard before it's seen, thanks to the whooping calls they use to communicate danger and call for their troop mates. When angered, they attack in ferocious packs, hurling rocks and pummeling threats en masse.
