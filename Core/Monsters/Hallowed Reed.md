## Description
---
{These small patches of pale, yellow and green reeds with bright white tips propagate by merging with nearby mundane grasses and weeds. The merging process slowly transforms the native plant into these sentient stalks. The reeds serve as the sensors of a lustrating grove, growing out from the grove for several miles like luminescent fingers stretching across the landscape.}

**_Ritual Use_**. The reeds sometimes allow small portions of their central mass to be cut away by good-aligned spellcasters. The pieces can be dried and carried or affixed to a holy symbol. The magic of hallowed reeds affects spells casts as rituals, often increasing their power, duration, or likelihood of success. Similarly, the reeds can be sacrificed in summoning rituals to increase the likelihood that the summoned creature will obey its master. For this reason, the reeds are hunted by evil diabolists and elementalists.

**_Rule of Three_**. It is rare for the hallowed reeds to grow in clusters numbering less than three. It is equally rare to encounter the reeds in numbers not divisible by three. Once three hallowed reeds come to maturity, they often sprout a young alabaster tree, which they protect until it fully matures.
