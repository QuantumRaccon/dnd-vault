## Description
---
_This short, reptilian humanoid has scales of dull yellow and gleaming copper. It is swathed in filthy robes absolutely festooned with scrap metal, chains, nails, and other bits of metal and wood refuse. It carries a staff made of a length of pipe, topped with a battered candelabra that burns with hissing flames._

Spindly even for kobolds, junk shamans weigh more than most thanks to the metal bits in which they decorate themselves.

**_Fringe Oracles_**. Most other kobolds look at the junk shamans as touched but can't deny that they channel some form of divine energy. A kobold community might openly shun a junk shaman, even while every member of the warren individually seeks the shaman out for wisdom and insight.

**_Treasures from Trash_**. A junk shaman eschews the normal, respectable kobold pursuits of mining, trapmaking, and sorcery. Instead, it provides an afterlife of sorts for castoff articles from kobolds and other races alike. It gathers massive collections of broken weapons, useless tools, scrap materials, and other detritus, imbuing the garbage with a semblance of life.
