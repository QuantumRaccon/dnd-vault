## Description
---
>The vague outline of a tortured being flickers, appearing as though it may have once been human. Its face is composed of many faces, and its expressions shift rapidly from madness to anger to pain. Its features change from one moment to the next, resembling one person for a short time, then someone else, or an odd combination of several at the same time.

**_Recombined Spirits_**. Chimeric phantoms are created when intelligent creatures, most often humanoid, are consumed by a [[kachlian]]. The [[kachlian]] keeps the pieces of the creatures' souls that it finds most valuable and discards the remainder. These discarded pieces of souls often combine into a single, ghost-like creature. Although the chimeric phantom retains fractured memories of the individuals it once was, none of these memories are fully realized, and no single partial soul is in control of the phantom. Chimeric phantoms are an amalgam of spirits and can be destroyed. However, the spirits that make up the phantom cannot be separated into their former selves, as core pieces of the original souls were consumed by the [[kachlian]] that created the phantom.

**_Insanity_**. Chimeric phantoms are destined to spend the remainder of their existence in a state of insanity. Each of the spirits fights to dominate the others to control the being they have become, though the spirits are doomed to never have a victor. Instead, the chimeric phantom is ruled by whatever emotion is strongest at that moment. The constant turmoil of its internal struggle leaves the chimeric phantom a chaotic mess of faces, voices, and body language that shift as its emotions change and as minor personalities take hold for seconds at a time. Its struggle is never-ending, permanently damaging the psyches of all the souls that make up the chimeric phantom. The fractured souls can never experience true peace until they have been completely destroyed, which requires destroying the chimeric phantom and the kachlian who made it.

**_Undead Nature_**. A phantom doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
