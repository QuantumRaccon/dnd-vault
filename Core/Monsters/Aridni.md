## Description
---
_Both more rugged and more ruthless than normal pixies, the aridni are an especially greedy breed of fey bandits and kidnappers._

**_Pale Archers_**. These ashen-faced fey with gray moth wings fire green-glowing arrows with a sneer and a curse. Aridni prefer ranged combat whenever possible, and they are quite difficult to lure into melee. They sometimes accept a personal challenge o respond to accusations of cowardice.

**_Caravan Raiders_**. They've developed different magical abilities that aid them well when they raid caravans for captives to enslave and sell; charming foes into slavery is a favorite tactic.

**_Wealth for Status_**. They delight in taking plunder from humans and dwarves, not so much for its own sake but as a sign of their power over mortals, and their contempt for those who lack fey blood.

> [!INFO] Aridni in Midgard
>When the elves abandoned the mortal world and returned to the elflands, not all of their fey servants went with them. Some stayed by choice; some were abandoned as tainted, feral broods; and some have remained to become servants of local gods or human mages. Most of them are angry at humans for their corruption of, and rebellions against, the elven courts and empires in Midgard. They seek to regain some of their fallen fey wealth and glory from humans and dwarves by stealing from, corrupting, and killing their ancient enemies. Among these abandoned fey are the aridni ("slaver pixies"), evil pixies suborned by the Slavers of Reth-Saal.
