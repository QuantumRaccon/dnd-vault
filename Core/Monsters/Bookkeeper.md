## Description
---
_As the tome is opened, a blob of ink splashes toward the reader's eyes, followed by mischievous giggles._

For those wary of prying eyes, a tiny construct made of ink can keep private journals, records of magical runes, or discoveries safe.

**_Tiny Guards_**. Created by wizards fearful of having their research stolen, bookkeepers are ink constructs bound to a designated book. They provide protection not just from unwanted intrusion but also from physical damage. The bookkeeper can move on its own when needed, but it spends most of its time hiding within the book it is assigned to guard.


**_Alarm_**. As long as the creator is on the same plane as the book, it is mentally alerted if the book is opened by anyone other than it. The book also shrieks if handled by anyone other than the creator. The creator does not set off any wards or alarms when opening its own book.


**_Construct Nature_**. A bookkeeper doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
