## Description
---
_A towering column of flesh, eyes, tentacles, and mouths wriggles in the air. Wild winds whip about the creature in all directions._

Flying polyps are ancient, wind-controlling aberrations that once dominated the Material Plane. They plot to take back what they believe is their rightful home.

**_Former Rulers_**. Flying polyps once ruled from cities of towers. Other creatures bowed to them until dragons appeared and refused to serve. A blood-soaked conflict ended with dragons victorious. They bound the few surviving polyps in the Ethereal Plane.


**_Exist in Two Worlds_**. After centuries in exile, the polyps uncovered a ritual that allowed them to exist in the Material Plane while still being bound to the Ethereal Plane. This ancient secret allows them to manipulate objects in the Material Plane as they please, but the use of this magic makes them vulnerable to lightning.


**_Masters of Weather and Distance_**. Flying polyps sometimes destroy crops, flood rivers, or call storms down on those who trouble their remote peaks and strongholds. Invisible and capable of covering vast distances in little time, they maintain a web of malign alliances from arctic regions to tropical peaks.
