## Description
---
_This giant, elderly woman, with long, unkempt hair, pendulous breasts, and horrific claws cracks a crooked smile. Her face is a horrifying, fanged mask with wild, protruding eyes, and her tongue is disturbingly long with curved spikes of bone along its edges._

Rangda, also known as the Wretched Lover and the Rot Within, is the demon queen of witches.

**_Sacrifice of Innocents_**. Worshippers of Rangda are required to deliver the babes of mortals unto her once a year. She delights in feasting upon these offerings, often swallowing them whole.


**_Cursed Enemies_**. Rangda, once the mortal lover of Barong, is now his eternal enemy. Her hate for Barong fuels her machinations, and she blames him for her misfortunes. In this, at least, she is correctâ€”Barong did betray her to darkness long ago, though she has since embraced it as an instrument of her vengeance.


**_Friend to Hags._**. Rangda is often accompanied by a halfdozen green or sea hags, occasionally by a few [[Night Hag \|night]] or [[Sand Hag \|sand hags]] (Tome of Beasts), and very rarely by one or two [[Blood Hag \|blood hags]]. The hags are messengers, guards, and allies of the demon queen.


**_Rangda's Lair_**. Rangda's lair is nestled beneath an immense, twisted tree strewn with corpse flowers and surrounded by warlock's trumpetblooms (see page 372) deep in a vast bog of the Abyss. The tree must reshape itself to grant access to the Witch Queen's abode, an earthy, worm-ridden manse that reeks of decay.
