## Description
---
_A pair of powerful hands made from a weird transparent substance springs forth from the puddle lying on the cavern floor._

Boot grabbers are ooze-like aberrant creatures that lie in wait for approaching prey on the floors of dank dungeons, overgrown ruins, and dark caverns.

**_Deadly Ambushers_**. Its transparent, amorphous body means a boot grabber is easily mistaken for a puddle or patch of wet rock, allowing the creature to strike with surprise and grab hold of its victim's legs or feet with its strong hand-shaped appendages. The boot grabber can lure a creature that is reluctant to approach by emitting an unearthly, high-frequency sound. Once it has seized its target, the boot grabber secretes a strong adhesive to stop the hapless creature from pulling free and continues to crush its foe's lower limbs. When the victim finally ceases struggling, the boot grabber flows over the helpless victim's body to start consuming it.


**_Creations of Warped Sorcery_**. Boot grabbers are believed to have been created centuries ago in twisted experiments conducted by deranged arcanists seeking new weapons to use against their rivals. Willing to wield fell sorceries that tapped into the alien power of the Void, these mages carried out all manner of blasphemous research. By melding alien protoplasm harvested from [[Shoggoth \|shoggoths]] (Tome of Beasts) with the dismembered bodies of human captives from a rival magocracy, the wizards created the boot grabber and other foul creatures, before ultimately spawning the first gibbering mouther.


**_Shadow Dwellers_**. Boot grabbers are usually encountered in underground locations on the Material Plane, but they also inhabit the Plane of Shadow, where they are sometimes used by shadow fey nobles as guardians in the tunnels beneath their castles. On both planes, boot grabbers can often be found working in tandem with the alien-looking darkmantles, hunting together and sharing the spoils. These partnerships prove very effective-the darkmantle's darkness aura conceals both creatures' presence, and a target held fast by the boot grabber can readily be engulfed by the darkmantle.
