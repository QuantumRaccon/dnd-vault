## Description
---
_This creature resembles a treasure map that flaps as if caught in a strong wind, even in a dungeon where the air is perfectly still. When touched, the map splits open, revealing its fanged mouth and face._

**_Mimic Spawn_**. Mimic adhesive is not just a powerful means of trapping prey, it also contains millions of microscopic larvae that feed on flesh. Most of the larvae are consumed by the mimic when it eats. Mimics are either unaware of this, or they're indifferent to the fact that they routinely cannibalize their own offspring. A few manage to survive, however, by adhering to the clothing or equipment of someone who escaped from a fully-grown mimic's attack. These larvae hitch a ride on their host, far from the dungeon, cavern, or ruins of their birth. There they drop off and grow into wormlike mimic young called map mimics. In time, map mimics grow into typical mimics.

**_Smaller than a Dinner Plate_**. Map mimics are too small to mimic the types of objects their parent does, but they can still deceive prey by altering their forms. They can assume the shape, texture, and coloration of anything up to the size of a dinner plate.

**_Paper Scrolls_**. Their preferred form is parchment paper, and they can display the path they've followed, complete with important landmarks, on their hide. In this form, they curl up and wait inside bottles, or in the clutches of corpses in plain view, until another unsuspecting adventurer discovers them. Anyone who follows the "map" is led back to the parent mimic, lying in ambush and hungry to be reunited with its offspring.
