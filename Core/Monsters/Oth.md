## Description
---
Oth are soozes that have lived at least 100 years. The oth command the soozes and pilot the strange oozing ships which carry the shoth from world to world. Oths take their orders from droths and negotiate with the creatures of a world. Their magic and natural charm help them to lead a creature, people, or species to the zolvs. Oths are large humanoids with four appendages, and they wear hooded cloaks. Their zoms are stored inside their chest and pulse rhythmically like a mortal heart.

**_Friendly_**. Oths are charismatic and friendly creatures, despite their oozing appearance. They have excellent senses of humor and can get along with nearly everyone. They sincerely want what is in the best interests of their allies. However, they work tirelessly to move their allies towards being dissolved since they see it as the best way of achieving ultimate kinship for all living creatures.
