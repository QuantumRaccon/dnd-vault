## Description
---
The eyes and ears of undead armies, darakhul spies originate from all nations and backgrounds.
**_Masters of Disguise_**. Darakhul spies are rarely without a slew of disguises, including wigs, colored pastes, cosmetics, and clothing appropriate for various nationalities and economic levels. Some of the best spies have spent decades hiding in plain sight in courts, taverns, and slums across the world.

**_Complex Network_**. Each spy has one superior to whom it reports, and each superior spy has a separate superior spy to whom it reports. Only the highest leaders have knowledge of the intricacies of the spy network, and even they aren't fully aware of the true identities of their furthest-reaching agents.

**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The darakhul doesn't require air or sleep.
