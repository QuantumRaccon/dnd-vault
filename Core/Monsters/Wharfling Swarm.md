## Description
---
_An undulating mass of flesh and teeth, a wharfling swarm is a horrific sight by moonlight._

**_Bloodthisty Mobs_**. These masses of hairless bodies writhe along the coast in the moonlight, and often are mistaken for shoggoths or other much larger creatures. Squeals mingle with the screams of the occasional unfortunate fisherman caught in its path.

**_Beach Swarms_**. Periodically, wharflings congregate in huge numbers and tear along the shoreline for miles before finally returning to their dens. Why they gather this way is unknown, but most locals know to avoid the shore on these nights.
