## Description
---
_This lumbering saurian quadruped has large, oblong plates of bone covered in greenish slime protruding from its back and its thick, club-like tail._

**_Large Plates_**. People describe this reptilian herbivore as "the animal with planks growing out of its back." The mbielu is a large dinosaur akin to a stegosaurus, with square dorsal plates that support symbiotic colonies of toxic, green algae. The plates themselves are as large as shields.

**_Aquatic Herbivore_**. An mbielu spends most of its life underwater, feeding on aquatic plants and avoiding the withering glare of the harsh sun, but it comes onto land frequently to sun itself for a few hours before immersing itself once again.

**_Toxic Alchemy_**. Its dorsal plate algae undergo an alchemical reaction in the continual transition between water and sky, especially during mbielu migrations to new watery dens. The algae produce a hallucinogenic contact poison that clouds the minds of most creatures. Mbielus themselves are immune to the toxin.
