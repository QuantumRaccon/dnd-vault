## Description
---
Crystal dragons are gregarious and free-spirited, and travelers consider them to be the most hospitable of the gem dragons. Though crystal dragons enjoy solitude as much as other gem dragons, they value family more than their isolationist kin. When on the Material Plane, they make their homes atop solitary mountain peaks, building magnificent palaces of shining ice to store their treasure hoards.

**_Angelic Appearances_**. Their hooked snouts and jagged dorsal spikes lend crystal dragons a fearsome, predatory appearance, but their frightful image is softened by the dazzling beauty of their scales. Crystal wyrmlings' scales are glossy white like the shells of their eggs, becoming translucent and prismatic as they age. Fully grown crystal dragons, when shining in the full light of the sun, might be mistaken for radiant angels.
