## Description
---
_The hulking abomination's necrotic skin is covered in glowing runes, and acid sloshes out of blackened punctures in its distended belly with every shambling step it takes. It has no eyes, but its head is covered with eye tattoos that seem to be looking everywhere at once._

**_Born of Failed Rituals_**. No force is more dangerous to an ambitious ogre mage than its own magic. Ogres are superstitious creatures, and their magi keep them in line through fear of arcane power. The most effective way for an ogre mage to remind its dullard brethren of their arcane might is by publically and dramatically communing with the tribe's ancestral spirits. An elophar is created when an ogre mage bungles a ritual to call forth the spirits of the dead. During this failed ritual, its conductor is instantly struck dead and all the summoned spirits run rampant, trying to possess their summoner's lifeless corpse all at once.


**_Controlled by Many Spirits_**. An elophar is not an unintelligent undead creature; it possesses the combined memories of all the spirits vying for control of its body. Because of the ceaseless struggle between the possessing spirits, the elophar rarely follows one course of action for long, erratically changing tactics from instant to instant.


**_Undead Nature_**. The elophar doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
