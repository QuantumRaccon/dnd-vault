## Description
---
_This celestial has the head, arms, and torso of a beautiful human, the gleaming eyes of an angel and the lower body of a pure white swan. Magnificent wings grow from its back, and its body is adorned with fine jewelery. It plays a calming melody on a stringed musical instrument. A near-identical angelic being stands close by its side._

Kinnara are half-human, half-bird angels who serve the gods of love, music, and wisdom. They are always encountered in pairs.
**_Inseparable Lovers_**. As mortals, each pair of kinnara were devoted lovers who lived virtuous lives dedicated entirely to each other and to the pursuit of wisdom and enlightened accomplishments. Upon their deaths, they became closely‑bonded celestials in the service of the gods.
**_Celestial Musicians_**. Kinnara are highly skilled singers, musicians, and dancers, performing beautifully as a duo in perfect harmony with one another. Kinnara see it as their duty to instruct humanity in the arts, and their patron gods will sometimes send pairs of the angels to the Material Plane to teach the performing arts in temples and monasteries. Many of the world's greatest bards have traveled to one of these temples to study under a pair of kinnara.
**_Sacred Guardians_**. Kinnara can often be found protecting holy sites and other centers of wisdom located in remote locations. Those kinnara dwelling on the Material Plane will watch over the well-being of mortals—particularly musicians and lovers—and may sometimes intervene to protect such mortals in times of danger. A cleric can summon a pair of kinnara with a conjure celestial spell cast using a 9th-level spell slot.
**_Immortal Nature_**. The kinnara angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
