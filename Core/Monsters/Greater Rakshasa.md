## Description
---
_This fiendish mastermind appears as a sleek, white tiger-headed humanoid with bright blue eyes, striking markings and impressive whiskers. Dressed in fine silk robes woven with golden patterns, he lounges indolently on a low seat, smoking a hookah held in his backward paw._

Greater rakshasas are more powerful cousins of standard rakshasas. When a truly wicked rakshasa is reincarnated after several lifetimes of treachery and depravity, it will return to the Material Plane from the Hells as a member of a higher caste.

**_Master Manipulators_**. Greater rakshasas are driven by a lust for power, keeping their true natures hidden as they maneuver themselves into the highest echelons of society. Some rule duchies, baronies, or even whole kingdoms, while others are content to be the power behind the throne, pulling the strings as the king's vizier or first minister. No scheme is ever too complicated for them, and they are willing to employ a variety of techniques to achieve their aims, including eloquence, deception, bribery, blackmail, and intimidation. Greater rakshasas are adept at assuming multiple identities to carry out their plots, sometimes whispering in the same person's ear from different guises to sway them.

**_Wickedly Decadent_**. A greater rakshasa seeks to live a life of luxury and vice. Like its lesser cousin, it takes pleasure in toying with mortals as it carries out its evil schemes, manipulating and corrupting foolish creatures, then feeding on their flesh when tiring of them. A greater rakshasa usually has several rakshasas in its service, as well as a number of charmed humanoid guards and retainers. Although it is a capable melee fighter, a greater rakshasa considers hand-to-hand combat beneath it, preferring to use magical domination and fear whenever possible.
