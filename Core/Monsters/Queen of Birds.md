## Description
---
_Brightly-colored wings shimmer in the sunlight as the tall woman folds them against her body. Her piercing, jewelâ€‘tone eyes glare down her long nose at those unfortunate enough to be bound to the land, her spear crackling with lightning._

Vashnaya the Swift and Wise is the Queen of Birds and Mistress of Wind and Sky. She rules the winds from her palace atop its delicate, impossibly thin spire, mistress of all she surveys. She soars on the winds that blow far above the ground, looking down on the world from on high. Warlords and rulers covet her favor and the information she gleans, while soldiers fear the thunder strike of her spear.
**_Words on the Wind_**. Birds of all sorts fly from far and wide, shifting their normal migratory patterns to visit the Queen of Birds. She adores their calls and songs but not only for their beauty. The Queen can understand the birds, and they enjoy telling her about everything they've seen and heard. Through these feathered informants, the Queen learns much of what transpires for many miles around her lair. Given enough time, she can learn about events on the far side of the world.

**_Commanding and Proud_**. The Queen of Birds sees herself as above all others, literally and figuratively. Other beings with the ability to fly sometimes visit her palace in hopes to obtain her advice. Reaching the palace is the first test the Queen places before any who would seek her favor; anyone who can't reach her abode isn't worth her time. Those who do reach her home and show proper deference to her station and wisdom might earn her favor. Any who forget their place might find themselves suddenly shown out of the palace and to the several-hundred-foot plummet to the ground.


**_The Queen of Birds' Lair_**. The Queen of Birds' lair is a strange sight. A thin stone spire only three feet wide rises from the ground to 500 feet in the air. Impossibly perched atop this spire is a palace with lush gardens, terraces, and open galleries. The Queen holds court in the palace Haval, surrounded by birds of all varieties and bird-like fey and humanoids such as ravenfolk.
**_Animal Lords_**. While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in celestial councils. The [[Queen of Serpents]] speaks to the gods of the desert, and the [[Queen of Birds]] holds a wide swath of territory with eyes drifting gently on updrafts throughout the world. Each animal lord sees and communicates with the members of its species in some mysterious and unknowable fashion. News from the granaries and the kitchens always finds its way to the [[Mouse King \|Mouse King's]] ears, and news from fields of battle or of wheat inevitably lands in the remote nest of the [[Lord of Vultures]].
What do the animal lords do with their legions and their vast array of information? Some sages believe they trade this to other figures, demon and angel alike, in exchange for favors understood best as celestial currency. Others say that they merely inform their followers of dangers to avoid, rich prey to hunt, or similar concerns. In many cases, the animal lords find they have both the time and inclination to meddle occasionally in the affairs of humanoids, especially those who are particularly kind or unusually cruel to their followers.
As a group, the animal lords look after their own, and they defend their territory and their wellsprings of power against humanoid encroachment. The great argument among the animal lords themselves is whether to align themselves with the humanoid world (as the [[Queen of Cats]] and, to some degree, the [[Mouse King]] have done) or to remain outside of it (as the others have).
