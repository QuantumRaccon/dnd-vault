## Description
---
_This figure is dressed in black robes, and every part of its body that isn't covered by robes is wrapped in gray bandages. It wields blood‑stained sickles in each bandaged hand and moves with menace._

Dark folk arose when a line of human wizards swore allegiance to shadow gods and passed this shadow power to their children. Easily mistaken for humans at a glance, the dark folk long ago diverged from their ancestors.

The lowliest of the dark folk, the dark servants are also the most numerous. They cover their skin completely to shield it from even a single mote of light. Dark servants are without empathy and prefer the company of other dark folk. Murderous and cruel, they have difficulty interacting with non‑dark folk for long.

**_Shadows among Light_**. Dark folk most often live near humanoid settlements. They worship the powers of darkness and shadow in secret, spreading their corruption in the dead of night and in darkened cellars. They often work nocturnal jobs as undertakers, night soil collectors, alchemists, or night watchmen, escaping the unrelenting glare of the sun.

**_Darkened Blood_**. Sometimes a family line carries the tiniest seed of darkness, and a dark folk is born. These pale children face difficult lives, often singled out and shunned by peers for the dark nature they can't ever fully hide. Though most dark folk look human, dark folk can descend from any humanoid (though they lose all traits associated with their heritage).
