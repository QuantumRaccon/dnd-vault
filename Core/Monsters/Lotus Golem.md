## Description
---
_Drawing power from the river's current, the creature's core glows brighter, and its flowery surface blossoms and fades in cycles like a dozen springtimes._

**_Magic Battery_**. Lotus golems absorb magical power from their surroundings, which spellcasters can utilize.


**_Flowering Strength_**. A lotus golem's body always has several blossoms, typically blooms of water plants. These are linked to its mystic strength: a lotus golem with only a few blossoms is far less powerful than one covered in them.


**_Seasonal Creations_**. The lotus golem is made of woven water plants and flowers. To make a lotus golem, the creator must use expert weavers with fresh materials and complete the ritual between sunset and sunrise along a river bank. The golems are much less durable than their clay or stone counterparts and usually last only a few seasons. When they fall apart, their reeds and papyrus elements are used to make spell scrolls.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
