## Description
---
_With a fang-filled maw and the glimmer of malevolent intelligence in its ruby red eyes, this shark-like creature glides through the depths in complete silence._

**_Relentlessly Territorial_**. This terrifying creature possesses a cunning and devious mind which it uses to bend others to its will. The devil shark considers itself superior to all other creatures of the sea and goes to great lengths to prove it. A merciless, vicious predator when active, a devil shark carves out and defends a territory for itself measured in leagues, relentlessly hunting down any creature it considers a competitor for primacy.


**_Slumbering Evil_**. The creature relies in part on the terror it spreads during its periods of activity to keep it safe and undisturbed during its long periods of dormancy. While dormant, it sleeps in deep undersea caves or ancient submerged structures of unknown artifice.


**_Object of Veneration_**. The devil shark is a solitary creature, though it sometimes enjoys the worship of sahuagin. As rapacious as the hungriest shark, the devil shark enjoys consuming the flesh of sentient creatures and looks kindly on those providing it with such sacrifices, though it will just as soon eat those same admirers should such offerings cease.
