>Eight tentacles reach out from the scorched body of this unusual octopus-like creature. Glowing yellow, orange, and red patches smolder on its skin, like embers flaring to life.

**_Elemental Bodies_**. Magma octopuses are creatures that physically resemble the marine animals for which they are named, but they make their homes in lava, swimming through it as easily as aquatic [[octopus \|octopuses]] swim through water. Born in the fiery seas of the Plane of Fire long ago, many magma octopuses wandered to the Material Plane through various portals and thinned barriers between the planes. They exist throughout the world, particularly in underground caverns with open lava flows, within the craters of some volcanoes, and swimming through underground networks of magma.

**_Intelligent_**. Magma octopuses live simple lives with a quiet intelligence that slightly surpasses that of aquatic octopuses. They have no language and cannot communicate verbally. They are known to recognize individuals from other species and remember individuals that might have caused them pain or helped them out of a bad situation. Magma octopuses only fight others if they are attacked first, but they can become extremely territorial if intruders tread too close to home. They have a fondness for fire-based magic and sometimes can be recruited to serve as guardians for wizards, [[efreeti]], and other powerful, fiery creatures.

**_Elemental Nature_**. A magma octopus doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
