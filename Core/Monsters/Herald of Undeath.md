## Description
---
_Skeletal and towering over the battle, the herald of undeath blasts the living in the name of its dark lord: "Hail the age of apocalypse, for your death is here! I shall reap you all into my master's fold, for I am the end times made flesh!"_

Fresh from the land of the dead, a herald of undeath is an enormous, undead servitor of the dark gods of undeath. It is often accompanied by [[flutterflesh]] (Tome of Beasts) scouts or a pack of wraiths, and it travels as a messenger to a [[hierophant lich]] or an evil high priest. The herald of undeath walks tirelessly to spread its master's grim message of death, doom, and decay.

**_Shrieking Bones_**. When struck by magic or by a magical weapon, the bones of the herald cry out in pain with the voices of the damned.


**_Separable Limbs and Eyes_**. The herald of undeath can detach its various limbs at any time, leaving them to act independently. It will often leave an eyeball somewhere to keep watch on a particular location.


**_Raises Entire Cemeteries_**. A herald of undeath can and will raise entire undead armies from large cemeteries, battlefields, or necropoli. There is no limit to the number of undead that will follow a herald of undeath, and even intelligent undead are not immune to its clarion call. Tribes of gnolls sometimes follow them, seeking chaos and easy plunder.


**_Undead Nature_**. A herald of undeath doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
