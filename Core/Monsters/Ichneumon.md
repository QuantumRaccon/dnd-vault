## Description
---
_With powerful jaws and teeth capable of shearing scales from meat with ease, the creature resembles a weasel the size of a brown bear._

**_Outsized Temerity_**. These creatures live in burrows and caves whose previous inhabitants were likely devoured by the new residents. Wily hunters, ichneumons prey upon all kinds of creatures, but they go to great lengths and far out of their way to feast on dragon eggs, or the dragons themselves if they can.


**_Resourceful Rodent_**. Ichneumons have a keen animal intelligence, and they make an innovative use of their environment. A musky oil with insulating properties coats the fur of an ichneumon, granting it a measure of protection. When an ichneumon has the luxury of time to prepare before hunting, it finds the nearest source of mud and applies layer after layer to itself. The mud bonds with the creature's oily coat and forms a hard, thick outer armor, enhancing its natural protections.


**_Hunted and Hated_**. The ichneumon's very existence is a source of humiliation and outrage for dragonkind. The mention of a dragon's name who was killed by an ichneumon is considered distasteful among dragons once they have hunted for the killer and settled the matter. Different standards of decency apply for other beings, however, and any non-dragon foolish enough to mention an ichneumon within hearing of a dragon might never be heard from again.
