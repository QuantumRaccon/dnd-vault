## Description
---
_Dwelling in the eternal twilight of deep jungles and shadowy canyons, these orcs are fond of plant camouflage and are sometimes covered in armor featuring plant spikes and spines. All are expert climbers._

**_Nocturnal Menace_**. Sheltering by day in caverns just beneath the surface, the orcs of the green abyss climb up into the world with the fall of night to hunt and make war in the jungle canopy. They often align themselves with particularly bloodthirsty druids and with [[Vine Lord \|vine lords]] (Tome of Beasts). They are immune to the vine lord's spore sacs and can't be transformed into tendril puppets.

**_Canopy-Dwelling Predators_**. Leaner and rangier than others of their kind, they stalk among the branches, spearing their prey below with poisons harvested from the deadly plants native to their home. Their nocturnal hunting hideaways resemble those of large apes; leafy nests that are difficult to spot from the ground.

**_Fierce Survivalists_**. Adept at surviving in an unforgiving world, these orcs survive through a mastery of poisons, use of simple-but-effective traps they leave for the unwary, and by snatching meals from the grip of man-eating flora. They are omnivorous and fond of devouring enormous beetles, roaches, and snakes which other humanoids would pass over.
