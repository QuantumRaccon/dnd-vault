## Description
---
In spite of, or perhaps because of, its slight statue, a gnomish knife cultist presents an unnerving figure. Its slightly unkempt hair pokes out from beneath a hat, and it constantly fidgets and shifts on its feet. Laughter erupts from it at inopportune moments during conversations. Gnomish knife cultists are the demon wranglers of their cults, summoning and managing whatever demons the cult needs to further its goals. They often can't resist the call of demons and have been known to summon rampaging demons unbidden, leading to many interrupted harvests or market days.
