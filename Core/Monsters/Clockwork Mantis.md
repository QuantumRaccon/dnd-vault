## Description
---
>This large clockwork mantis is surprisingly nimble and fast, capable of taking down foes with a lethal flurry of serrated claws and bites.

These marvelous mechanical constructs were originally designed by the gnomish master engineer, Zook. Dreading that they were too powerful to be released into the world and fall into the wrong hands, he secreted them away. Whether they were released by a destruction-bent agent of chaos, or they somehow effected their own freedom, they are now a threat to any who cross their paths.
**_Uncontrollable and Invisible_**. In the past, Zook was able to control his machines, which were built to be [[invisible]] agents and protectors. But the creations outlived their creator. If the secret to controlling the creatures exists anywhere, it is within the heavily secured vaults Zook left behind.

**_Wanted by Gnomes_**. The existence of these wandering clockwork monsters creates a bad reputation for peaceful gnomish engineers. A few groups of gnomes specialize in tracking and destroying these clockwork creations. They claim to do it out of virtue, but rumors abound that they do it for rare parts or the possibility of tracking down old Zook's vault.

**_Construct Nature_**. The clockwork mantis doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.
