## Description
---
>The halfling takes a long drink from a mug, its wild, graying hair falling back to reveal the creature's pointed nose and sharp chin. Its bloodshot eyes hold a glimmer of mischief as it sets down the mug.

**_Tavern Spirits_**. Sileni adopt a specific tavern or inn as their own. The presence of a silenal is usually discovered slowly by the owner. Perhaps they notice the bar towels have all been mended or that the empty bottles have been placed outside the back door. If the owner accepts this assistance and leaves small gifts of food and drink, the silenal becomes more active. After hours, the silenal spends its time ensuring the establishment is cleaned to a shine and ready for the next day's business. If the owner and the silenal are at odds, however, the small mischiefs and mishaps caused by the silenal quickly drive the owner out of business.

**_Flawed Advisors_**. While the business is open, a silenal spends most of its time drinking and conversing with the patrons. Sileni are curious about mortals and find their tales and troubles fascinating. If a creature conversing with a silenal asks it for advice, the counsel received is invariably flawed. The silenal, interested in hearing more dramatic tales, offers guidance which is guaranteed to get its conversation partner in hot water in the hopes the recipient will return to lament new, entertaining troubles.

**_Calm in the Storm_**. Regardless of how chaotic activity gets in its bar, the silenal is strangely unaffected. Tavern brawls, whether caused by the silenal or not, never target it. The damage caused by fights is also reduced and rarely results in more than a few broken chairs and tankards.
