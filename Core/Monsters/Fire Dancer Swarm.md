## Description
---
_A swirling mass of tiny, blue flames dances with the likeness of a skull embedded in each little, flickering fire._

**_Stunted Elementals_**. Fire dancers are Tiny fire elementals. Speculation varies whether they're simply immature or somehow stunted. They may be castoffs from larger, fiery elemental beings. A single, solitary fire dancer is no more than a semi-sentient spark with a fragment of life and lofty but unrealistic ambitions. In large numbers, they're a menace.

**_Unite and Grow Strong_**. Larger fire elementals are usually sessile creatures, content merely to exist on their plane of origin. Fire dancers possess (and some argue are infected with) mortal qualitiesâ€”they seek to reach a greater potential, which smacks of envy, ambition, and resentment. They realize that there is power in numbers and that, when united, they are a force to be reckoned with. A single fire dancer is no more threatening than a tiny candle flame, burning hot and blue. When thousands of join together, though, the result is an inferno. The likeness of a skull in its flame is an illusion created by the creature, based on how the fire dancers perceive mortal creatures after they're done with them.

**_Surly Servants_**. Lone fire dancers have individuality, but in groups, they develop a hive mentality. While this allows them to function as a swarm, it also makes them vulnerable as a group to mind-affecting magic. Savvy bards, conjurers, and enchanters who summon swarms of fire dancers know they must maintain a tight control on the swarm, for these creatures are surly servants at the best of times.
