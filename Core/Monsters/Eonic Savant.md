## Description
---
>A jagged blue scar of magical energy forms in the air, and a blue-robed figure steps out a moment later. As it moves, echoes of it appear to move a split second before and after it. The creature focuses its attention and the echoes solidify around it, one wielding the creature's staff, the other a spell.

The eonic savant is an [[eonic drifter]] (Tome of Beasts) who learned to fully harness the power of its many future and past selves.
**_Still Adrift in Time_**. Through their mastery of time, they were able to spare their bodies many of the same ravages of time experienced by their brethren. In spite of this mastery, they are no closer to finding the cure or the correct time stream for their dying ancient civilization.

**_Calm and Assured_**. Unlike their kin, eonic savants hold the energy to jump through time within their bodies, freeing them from a reliance on their people's crystal belts and the paranoia its loss brings. Savants devote themselves to studying the rivers of time and helping their kin, who are barely surviving time's flood. They are certain with enough study and enough of their kin by their sides, they can discover the way to a cure and the way home.
