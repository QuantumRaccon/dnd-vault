## Description
---
Neogi are vicious, spiderlike scavengers, raiders, and slavers that sometimes disguise their predatory practices beneath a guise of mercantile dealings. They travel vast distances in their eerie, weightless ships.
**_Slave Takers_**. The appearance of neogi vessels or caravans in a land is seldom taken as a good event. Neogi are great traders and merchants, but they are even greater raiders and despoilers. They trade if they must, but they prefer to fill their holds with treasure and slaves by simply taking what they want and leaving ruin in their wake.
Neogi can psychically dominate other creatures, enslaving them to their will. On raids, neogi always take new slaves to add to their empire. With the constant replenishing of workers, the neogi have the means to fashion large fleets and dangerous weapons. Lands near neogi territory are always at risk of raids or even outright invasion.

**_Strange Outsiders_**. The neogi are a great mystery to other races. They are strangers wherever they go. Their anatomy is alien. No one knows where they come from. They are foreign even in the Underdark.
On other levels, the neogi are perfectly easy to understand. They are rapacious plunderers, greedy merchants, gleeful murderers, and slave hunters of the worst kind. They view everything, including their own lives, as something to be owned, and anything that can be owned is worth taking by any means.

**_Life Cycle_**. Neogi undergo three distinct stages in their lives: spawn, adult, and great old master. Spawn are small, hungry hunters, barely sentient. Adults are the most commonly encountered neogiâ€”voracious, cruel, and brilliant monsters consumed with lust for gold and power. Great old masters are huge, bloated neogi approaching the end of their life spans, serving as living incubators for the next generation of neogi spawn.

> [!INFO] Spelljammer Helms
>As the neogi were originally from the Spelljammer campaign setting, their culture makes heavy reference to the flying ships that traverse between worlds in this setting, the spelljammer helms. With the help of these flying ships, the neogi spread their influence to every world, and across every world. Thus, trade and piracy are of chief importance to the neogi.
>If your setting does not have spelljammer helms or similar airships, you can still incorporate the neogi in your settings in a number of other ways. Perhaps the neogi are a strictly subterranean race, like the drow, and control a similar, or even rival, empire. Or perhaps the neogi launch their raids from the mountains and forests, establishing vast trade networks over land and sea. Whatever the implementation, the neogi are a powerful and formidable addition to any campaign world.
