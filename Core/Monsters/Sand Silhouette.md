## Description
---
_Sand silhouettes are spirits of those who died in desperation in sandy ground, buried during sandstorms, thrown into dry wells, or the victims of a dune collapse. Looking like a shadow stretched out along the ground, a sand silhouette's erratic movements are difficult to discern._

**_Sand Bodies_**. If disturbed or agitated, these restless souls cause the sand around them to swirl and form into a loose vortex that vaguely resembles their physical body in life. They can control these shapes as they controlled their physical bodies.

**_Traceless Movement_**. Sand silhouettes glide through the sand without leaving a trace or creating any telltale sign of their approach, which makes it easy for them to surprise even cautious travelers with their sudden attacks from below.
