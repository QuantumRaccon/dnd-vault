## Description
---
_Clad in a simple, plain robe, this creature has the head of a massive ox with wide, sweeping horns and short, dark fur covering its powerfully-muscled body. It stands as still as a statue on one of its feet with the other braced against its opposite knee. The only sound it makes is the deep, rhythmic rush of its breath._

**_King of Rodents_**. The Mouse King is the King of all rodents, and he spends his days looking after the concerns of rodents on the Material, Astral, and Ethereal Planes. When slain, he is reborn within a week. As king, he often sees the taint of [[Chittr'k'k, Demon Lord of Rats \|Chittr'k'k's]] influence on his subjects. Thankfully, his people's ability to rapidly multiply leaves him with plenty of resources to defend his kind against the machinations of the Demon Lord.

**_In the Company of Thieves_**. The Mouse King can always be found at the head of a guild of thieves. He schemes to make sure his wealth continues to grow, which often means entering into conflict with other gangs.

**_Civic-Minded Scoundrel_**. When it comes to making money, he takes into account what is best for the long‑term prosperity of the city in which he operates, which he rightly believes is integral to his own success and that of his subjects. He is a great proponent of trade of all kinds, and his subjects have found their way to every corner of the world in the company of sailors, merchants, and drovers.


> [!INFO] Mouse King in Midgard
>Myzi the First and Lord of the Undercity resides in Zobeck. His interests and, some say, his mortality are tied to that city. When Myzi dies, his spirit inhabits the body of another mouse or rat in Zobeck, transforming it within a week into his next incarnation. He strives to help Zobeck prosper as it is good for his people and his coffers. He uses the city's trade routes and river barges to take his informants far and wide.
>Another Mouse King lives in the cities of Midgard outside of Zobeck. This Mouse King, like the other Animal Lords, is focused entirely on the preservation and betterment of his own kind. He strives to promote coexistence of humanoids and his people by keeping his feet both in the criminal underground and in the local political arena. Though many wonder to which he is truly loyal, all agree he aims to do what is best for his city in the long-term.
>No one has ever seen Myzi and the Mouse King side‑by‑side, leading some to believe they are one and the same. When asked, Myzi and the Mouse King both refuse to comment on the matter or acknowledge the existence of the other.
**_The Mouse King's Lair_**. The Mouse King lives in the alleys and sewers of cities. Cities with a high amount of underground and criminal activity are especially attractive to the Mouse King. His lair is full of twisting sewer pipes of various sizes and dark alleyways leading to dead ends or in circles. Some of the pipes and alleyways lead to sewers and alleys in different cities, placing the Mouse King's lair in a space between cities.
**_Animal Lords_**. While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in celestial councils. The [[Queen of Serpents]] speaks to the gods of the desert, and the [[Queen of Birds]] holds a wide swath of territory with eyes drifting gently on updrafts throughout the world. Each animal lord sees and communicates with the members of its species in some mysterious and unknowable fashion. News from the granaries and the kitchens always finds its way to the [[Mouse King \|Mouse King's]] ears, and news from fields of battle or of wheat inevitably lands in the remote nest of the [[Lord of Vultures]].
What do the animal lords do with their legions and their vast array of information? Some sages believe they trade this to other figures, demon and angel alike, in exchange for favors understood best as celestial currency. Others say that they merely inform their followers of dangers to avoid, rich prey to hunt, or similar concerns. In many cases, the animal lords find they have both the time and inclination to meddle occasionally in the affairs of humanoids, especially those who are particularly kind or unusually cruel to their followers.
As a group, the animal lords look after their own, and they defend their territory and their wellsprings of power against humanoid encroachment. The great argument among the animal lords themselves is whether to align themselves with the humanoid world (as the [[Queen of Cats]] and, to some degree, the [[Mouse King]] have done) or to remain outside of it (as the others have).
