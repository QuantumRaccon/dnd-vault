## Description
---
Formicans are a variety of sentient giant ants with an incredibly regimented hierarchy. They manifest in a variety of forms depending upon their rank within the colony.

These insects are the size of a pony and are typically avoided at all costs.

**_Complex Hierarchy_**. Formicans have no queens like a conventional ant colony but are led by a council of formican psions, who psychically assault any enemies of their nest. Being mentally superior, psions organize the leadership of the nest but are physically outmatched by the formican shockers. These hulking guard insects, with their oversized jaws and statically charged bodies, are capable of cleaving a man in two. Below these are the soldiers, who eventually evolve to replace shockers lost in battle. Next come the drones; winged ants who scout for new nest sites and foes. The bottom rank is the workers; still formidable foes but more docile, dedicating their time to rearing young and nest construction.

**_Voracious Predators_**. To keep their colonies alive, formicans scavenge almost anything they can get their mandibles on. Their immense size means they require a huge quantity of food and their young are no different. Formicans have been known to devour flocks of sheep, herds of cattle, and unlucky villages of halflings.

**_Towering Nests_**. Like regular ants, formicans create towering mounds which contain nests in which to live. These structures are enormous, reaching at least as high as human architecture. Often, these nests are dug into cliff faces, under the ground, or are formed from the trunks of pine trees. Because of their need for construction materials, formicans can tear through a forest or mountain range to gather available timber and stone. Formicans also have a habit of hoarding valuable stones and minerals. It is said that anyone brave, or foolish enough to invade a nest will be set for life from the treasure within; if they can escape that is.
