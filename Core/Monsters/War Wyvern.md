## Description
---
_This wyvern's thick armor, jagged claws, and heavy brow belies a pair of intelligent eyes. It looks upon its rider like a hound looks at its master._

Bred to be fearsome, obedient, and intelligent mounts for elite knights, war wyverns are superior in all ways to their wild cousins. Their natural scales are enhanced with thick steel scale armor, and selective breeding has granted them the ability to spit venom, in addition to delivering it with their scorpion-like tails.

**_Loyal and Deadly_**. A war wyvern is unflinchingly loyal and has been taught to unerringly follow verbal commands given by its master. In military situations, a wyvern's master will often command it to snatch cavalry riders from their horses with its steel-tipped talons, hurling them to their doom, or to use its spiked tail to smash siege weapons or supply wagons. Despite their viciousness on the battlefield, these domesticated wyverns serve their masters out of love, not fear, and act like energetic pit bulls when around those who treat them with kindness.

**_Two Fight as One_**. Wyvern knights and their war wyverns act as a single unit in combat. A war wyvern cannot move or take actions independently while it is being used as a mount, but its specialized training gives it the ability to make a single attack when its rider takes the Multiattack action.
