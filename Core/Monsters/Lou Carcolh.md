## Description
---
_A slimy green serpent with a hardened shell-like growth upon its back, the lou carcolh epitomizes the horror of both snake and snail. Its venomous maw features two needle-sharp fangs._

**_Trappers_**. The lou carcolh's preferred means of capturing prey is laying an ambush with its many mouth appendages stretched great distances, entrapping creatures who touch or step on them. The appendages regrow daily, so it is never without a fresh set.

**_Steeds to Dark Fey_**. Some dark fey creatures tame and ride lou carcolh as steeds. Their surprising speed, climbing ability, and comfort in the water make them ideal for traversing dread wetlands and fetid forests.
