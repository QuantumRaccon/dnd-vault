## Description
---
_The rough shape of a man with a crown and beard of sea foam rises out of the center of the maelstrom on a swirling pillar of dark clouds and seawater. Raging, his fist clutches a crackling ball of lightning._

**_Violent Sea Kings_**. Native to the Plane of Water, storm lords make war on each other over territory and pride, but they also command their lesser elemental kin in battle against intruders from other planes. Less frequently, storm lords leave their home plane to address some perceived wrong or slight, but, in some cases, they are summoned to serve greater elemental tempests and hurricanes.


**_Voice of Thunder_**. Foul tempered at the best of times, storm lords consider communication with non-aquatic creatures to be beneath them, preferring to settle disagreements with violence.


**_Acknowledged Kinship_**. While they spurn most diplomatic attempts, storm lords receive such overtures more charitably when brought to them by aquatic creatures.


**_Elemental Nature_**. The storm lord doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
