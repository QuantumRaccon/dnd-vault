## Description
---
_Made of fiery smoke coalescing into a vaguely humanoid shape, a firegeist is little more than wisps of black smoke and spots of brighter flame._

**_Elemental Echoes_**. When a fire elemental meets its destruction in a particularly humiliating fashion while summoned away from its home plane, what returns is a firegeist. Malevolent and resentful, less than their former prideful selves, they exist for revenge.

**_Indiscrimate Arsonists_**. Firegeists are not adept at telling one humanoid from another, and so burning any similar creature will do, providing it is flammable.

**_Brighter Light, Darker Smoke_**. A firegeist can shine brightly or be primarily smoky and dark, as it wishes. It always sheds a little light, like a hooded lantern.
