## Description
---
>The small cat emits a horrific yowl as its body begins to bulge and swell. Within moments, a massive, veined humanoid covered in patches of fur stands in the cat's place, casting a mad gaze.

**_Not of This World_**. A catscratch comes from parts unknown. No one is quite sure of its source, but wherever domestic cats are found, these creatures appear. It is a hybrid monster, created when an aberrant virus infects a cat or cat-like humanoid.

**_Summoned by Rage_**. An infected cat doesn't transform until it becomes angry, leaving many communities unaware of the disease until it is too late. Once a cat is sufficiently upset, it swells to a massive size, turning into a catscratch intent on destroying everything in sight.


> [!INFO] Catscratch Fuge
>Catscratch fugue is a bacterial infection that only affects felids and feline humanoids. This infectious organism is carried by debris falling into the Material Plane from the Void and is transmitted either through contact with the crash site or by being bitten by a carrier.
>Upon contact, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Once the host is infected, catscratch fugue incubates inside it for 3 days. During this window, the victim's skin itches, and they are prone to violent mood swings. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature can repeat the saving throw, recovering from the disease on a success. A [[lesser restoration]] spell cast during the incubation time cures the disease.
>After the third day, if the infection is still present, any negative emotion causes the victim to transform into a monstrous catscratch intent on destroying everything around it. Only a [[wish]] spell can cure a catscratch once it has transformed.
