## Description
---
>Falsifier fogs are foul urban mists that seek to distort the memory and manipulate the reality of victims using illusion and enchantment.

**_Delusory Misery_**. Falsifier fogs feed on the continued anxiety and depression they foment in populated towns and cities, using their unique abilities to infect large groups at a time. They do not look to kill victims, instead hoping to feed on distress for as long as possible.

**_Relishing Manipulators_**. Falsifier fogs are the souls of abusers and cult leaders who died collaborating with or benefitting from the manipulations of dark forces. Sometimes falsifier fogs form mutually beneficial relationships, willingly cooperating with evil spellcasters to spread misery. [[green hag \|Green hags]] are particularly fond of falsifier fogs, and large covens of the hags regularly aid and call on fogs.

**_Illusion and Enchantment_**. Often confused as fog or a passing cloud of smoke, falsifier fogs actively use subtle illusion to delude their victims and make them doubt their experiences and the validity of their feelings.

**_That Voice in the Back of Your Head_**. Their unique telepathy is their most effective tool. They assume the identity of a victim's inner discourse, spreading doubt and delusion while dispelling any efforts made by the victim to reality-check.

**_Undead Nature_**. The falsifier fog doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
