## Description
---
>Despite having bony sickles for paws, this large weasel moves adroitly as snow and ice whip around it.

**_Related to Wind Weasels_**. Kamaitachis derive from a family group of [[wind weasel \|wind weasels]] (Creature Codex) that migrated and acclimated to far northern forests. As a result, they lost their connection to the fey, shrinking and devolving into more natural beasts. Their claws fused to become one large, sickle-like claw on each paw. They retain the wind weasels' jealousy of humanoids and aggressively attack intruders.

**_Stinging Winds_**. Like their fey cousins, the kamaitachis can turn into a swirl of wind, but they incorporate ice and snow instead of leaves, chilling their victims. Even in their weasel forms, they surround themselves with wintry precipitation that obscures them from sight.

**_Summer Migrations_**. Kamaitachis thrive for most of the year in arctic forests. Prior to summer, they migrate closer to the pole to stay in contact with frozen water, most of which disappears in their forests during the warmer weeks. Once snows begin to fall again, they return to their forests and relentlessly drive out creatures that moved in during their absence.
