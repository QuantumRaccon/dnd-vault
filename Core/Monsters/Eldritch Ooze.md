## Description
---
>The dark gelatinous creature's form constantly shifts and swirls incomprehensibly.

There are places in the depths of the world where the barrier between the Material Plane and the Void grows thin. When a black pudding spends too much time in one of these places, it absorbs the foul energies and becomes an eldritch ooze. These creatures move mindlessly through the lightless depths, seeking wills to destroy.
**_Drawn to Madness_**. Despite their mindlessness, eldritch oozes seem to be drawn to areas where madness is already rampant. When they escape to the surface world, they inevitably migrate to asylums or other locations where the insane congregate.

**_Ooze Nature_**. An eldritch ooze doesn't require sleep.
