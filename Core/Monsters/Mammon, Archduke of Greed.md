## Description
---
This massive demon is made of money. His corpulent body is clad only in a woven platinum loincloth and a myriad of golden bangles, necklaces, rings, and chains. His skin is a deep golden hue, and his bald head is surmounted by a magnificent crown. The figure's grin is wide, wicked, and dripping with avarice.

**_Rich and Ostentatious_**. Mammon, the Golden Duke, the Arch-Devil of Greed, embodies the desire for material wealth that is so prevalent in mortals, and he has grown fat on the Material Plane's greed. Supplicants enter into service with Mammon, hoping desperately for a taste of the mind-boggling treasures that flow through his realm. The Arch-Devil of Greed rarely has to try to corrupt souls—they willingly cast themselves onto his counting room floor.
Befitting his appetites, Mammon is a rotund devil, and massively tall. He clads his golden body in ostentatious wealth. His only concession to actual clothing is a scant loincloth woven from platinum threads.

**_Greed Embodied_**. Mammon's greed knows no bounds. It is the one constant that allows mortals hope when dealing with him. If Mammon wants something badly enough, he spares no expense to get it, and even the lowliest supplicant can leverage that desire to his gain. Damned souls can be rescued from the Halls of Avarice by trading some unique bauble that has escaped Mammon's collection, or by offering to deliver an even more valuable soul in their place. Of course, such promises must be delivered, which means somehow coercing or tricking another living person into Mammon's clutches.


**_Arch-Devils_**. The rulers of Hell are the arch-devils, some arch-dukes and princes, others mere barons—but all with great longing to advance themselves and seize power.
**_Mammon's Lair_**. Mammon resides within a realm of overwhelming opulence. The forests grow golden trees with emerald leaves. Streams of liquid silver wind past fields of lapis wildflowers. The Archdevil of Greed's home, the Halls of Avirice, is in the heart of a golden city. Everything within his palace is made of a precious substance, and it is filled to bursting with breathtaking treasures.
