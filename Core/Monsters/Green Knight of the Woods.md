## Description
---
_Clad in emerald green plate mail and a cloak woven from leaves, this mysterious knight wields a mighty battle axe. A shield decorated with greenery is strapped to his arm._

**_Fey Champions_**. Green knights serve the Fey Lords and Ladies, acting as their champions and protecting those ancient forests where the borders between the Material Plane and the lands of the fey are thin. They are creatures of honor, and they are sometimes sent by a fey noble to test the integrity and honesty of a mortal knight by challenging the mortal to a duel or other contest. Beneath their plate armor, green knights appear as heavily built humanoids with a greenish tinge to their skin.


**_Forest Hideaways_**. Green knights make their homes in "green chapels" deep in the woods. These places are sometimes ruined churches or keeps overgrown with moss, vines and other foliage, or hidden forest gorges guarded by [[Woodwose \|woodwoses]] or other fey creatures. Green knights often ride greenâ€‘skinned, fey warhorses into battle (use warhorse statistics with the Magic Resistance trait and plate barding).
