## Description
---
_Wearing silver and red enamel pectoral jewelry and stylized armlets, as well as carrying a thin, carved stick, this angular, darkeyed human appears almost normal. When it moves, gears clash and whir faintly within it._

**_Lifelike Servants_**. Shabti are constructs made to tend to the needs of their masters in the afterlife. Dressed in ceremonial regalia, they are sometimes mistaken for living beings by intruders into their ancient tombs, though careful examination reveals faintly glowing hieroglyphs graven into their garments and their bodies.

**_Insane Machines_**. Usually driven mad by centuries within its master's tomb, a shabti fiercely attacks anything that threatens its sworn charge. Some ceaselessly babble ancient scriptures or invocations to the gods of death.

**_Ancient Weapons_**. A shabti fights by releasing its serpentine armlets, then using telekinesis against spellcasters while thrashing anyone within reach with archaic but effective stickfighting maneuvers. The shabti's weapon, the nabboot, is a 4-foot stick made of rattan or bundled reeds; this weapon was common in ancient forms of single-stick fighting. Shabti always fight until destroyed.
