## Description
---
_When a dune mimic strikes, the sand surges and shifts, a sinkhole opens, and sandy tendrils snatch at nearby creatures._

**_Enormous Forms_**. Though most commonly seen as dunes, a dune mimic make take the form of a date palm grove, a riverbank, an enormous boulder, or other large shapes in the landscape.

**_A King's Guardians_**. Dune mimics were created by a forgotten king as guardians for his desert tomb. Somewhere, dozens of them guard vast wealth.

**_Spread by Spores_**. Although not intended to reproduce, they began producing spores spontaneously and replicating themselves, so that now they're spread across the deserts. Luckily for the other inhabitants, dune mimics reproduce just once per century.
