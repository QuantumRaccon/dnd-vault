## Description
---
_From the pile of bones, a skull rises into the air as the hood of an old cloak slips from it and drops to the floor. A baleful greenish light pours from its hollow sockets. Its jaws open wide and a rasping voice utters words in a strange tongue._

**_Accidental Animation_**. A form of enigmatic, semi-sentient undead, a skull lantern comes into being spontaneously, soon after the destruction of another humanoid undead. It rarely lasts long, however, due to the fact that its first act is often to levitate slowly above a recently-vanquished undead creature's remains with eerie light shining from its eye sockets.

**_Traces of Life_**. Skull lanterns are given to muttering, repeating nonsense phrases, and even occasionally shouting, though what excites them to such utterings is as yet unknown; there seems to be no rhyme or reason to it. In fact, it isn't entirely clear if skull lanterns are inhabited by some spiritual remnant of their former selves or if they are occupied by some other entity altogether. Whether or not such behavior is a sign of intelligence at work, their willingness to communicate becomes more pronounced the closer they come to places of arcane power.

**_Enigmatic Companions_**.  A few brave experimenters have discovered that these beings can be put to several uses. If a creature tethers a skull lantern to itself and pulls the skull along for an hour, the skull will begin floating next to the creature of its own volition; a useful trait, since the skull produces a somewhat ghastly, but steady, light. It will float along in this way until something stops it from doing so, either by attacking it, separating from it through the use of a barrier of some sort, or placing it in a container. When abandoned, a skull lantern simply floats in place where it was left and won't take up following another creature until tethered and "trained" to do so again. When attacked, a skull lantern will defend itself with its bite but otherwise will not attack.

**_Undead Nature_**. A skull lantern doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
