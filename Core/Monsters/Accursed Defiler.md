## Description
---
_A gaunt figure in a tattered black mantle shrouded in a cloud of whirling sand. Thin cracks run across its papyrus-dry skin and around its hollow, black eyes._

**_Cursed to Wander and Thirst_**. Accursed defilers are the remnants of an ancient tribe that desecrated a sacred oasis. For their crime, the wrathful spirits cursed the tribe to forever wander the wastes attempting to quench an insatiable thirst. Each defiler carries a parched sandstorm within its lungs and in the flowing sand in its veins. Wherever they roam, they leave only the desiccated husks of their victims littering the sand.

**_Unceasing Hatred_**. The desperate or foolish sometimes try to speak with these ill-fated creatures in their archaic native tongue, to learn their secrets or to bargain for their services, but a defiler's heart is blackened with hate and despair, leaving room for naught but woe.

**_Servants to Great Evil_**. On very rare occasions, accursed defilers serve evil high priests, fext, or soulsworn warlocks as bodyguards and zealous destroyers, eager to spread the withering desert's hand to new lands.
