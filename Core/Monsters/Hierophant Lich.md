## Description
---
>A pious word always on its dusty lips, the lich seemed content to count its beads and let dust rattle in its throat. Until, at last, it turned to us and said "I will share my dark blessings with your feeble souls"—and unleashed horrors I shudder to remember.
The hierophant lich is a dry, dusty skeleton with fragments of hair and skin and a fierce, raging light of unholy zeal blazing in its eyes. It is often crowned by a black halo, wreathed in purple flames, or wielding a staff topped with a demonic head that whispers vile suggestions or wicked prophecies to it.

**_Servants of Dark Gods_**. The hierophant lich is always a devout follower of a dark god, demon lord, arch‑devil, or creature of outer darkness. When the hierophant's mortal lifetime would normally end, its dark master grants it additional life, so that it may continue to serve darkness. Usually, this gift is dispensed as part of the burial rites of the hierophant lich. The creature rises just as its body is about to be buried. In other cases, it leaves its tomb shortly after burial, or it stands up when the fires of its cremation are just starting to catch.

**_Reborn at the Altar_**. Each hierophant lich has a sacred vessel that protects its vile soul. So long as this altar, unholy relic, or other sacred object remains whole, the hierophant lich is never permanently slain.

**_Pure Evil Bones_**. The bones of a hierophant lich are said to contain deep, unholy power that serves to produce unholy scrolls, wardings, or wands.

**_Undead Nature_**. A hierophant lich doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
