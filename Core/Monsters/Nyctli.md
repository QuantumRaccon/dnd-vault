## Description
---
>A diminutive ball of sickly-looking flesh with an elven face clings to the underside of a rotting log, its body covered in barbed stingers.

**_Lurking Terrors_**. Nyctli dwell in moist, dark places, where their coloration and size enable them to easily hide. They delight in torturing other creatures, and nothing makes a nyctli giggle more than seeing its victim flounder about under the effects of its venom.

**_Hag-Born Horrors_**. The first nyctli were born from the boils of [[green hag \|green hags]], and the nyctli exhibit a strange affinity for them. Green hags sometimes use the nyctli as spies against nearby humanoid settlements.
