## Description
---
_This emaciated, gray husk of a creature wears rags and picks hungrily at a sliver of bone. It moves in a crouch so low that it's almost crawling, but its eyes glow like flickering coals and it exudes a desperate ferocity with each raspy, rot-fouled breath._

**_Lesser Ghouls_**. Most citizens of the ghoul empire are not darakhul but lesser strains of ghouls and ghasts. Beggar ghouls are by far the weakest of these. Though they make up the majority of any military action involving the legions, they are employed as fodder, and the most wretched of them are barely suitable even for that. They eke out miserable livings by scrounging for food near the surface or by begging in the ghoul cities.

**_Withered and Deprived_**. Thin and emaciated even for undead, beggar ghouls are shriveled versions of their standard cousinsâ€”little more than flesh-covered skeletons. While some beggar ghouls spend their entire existence in undeath as this weak strain, at least a few were once stronger ghouls who withered when they were trapped far from sources of flesh. Others were exiled from the empire without the resources to fend for themselves.
