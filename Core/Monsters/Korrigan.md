## Description
---
_Similar in appearance to a gnome or leprechaun, these pointy-eared faerie folk stand just under two feet tall. They have mischievous, flashing eyes and long, beautiful hair woven with pretty flowers. Clad in yellow robes and floral garlands, they sing and dance barefoot._

**_Night-time Revels_**. The korrigan are reclusive forest‑dwellers who emerge from their woodland grottoes at night to dance and sing amongst ancient standing stones or around waterfalls and streams. By night, they appear beautiful; however, by day, they are ugly and wizened, and their lovely brown hair turns scraggly and white.

**_Mischievous Merrymakers_**. When the moon is full, the korrigan begin their revels, joining hands and dancing in circles, singing melodies so joyous that others feel compelled to join. Unfortunately, dancing for too long can prove dangerous—even deadly—to mortals, especially "stodgy" religious folk, who lack the stamina of the fey. When they are not at their revels, korrigan enjoy humiliating mortals by making the creatures do silly things. If its victim doesn't see the funny side of its pranks, a korrigan can exhale its poisonous breath on the creature to dispatch the humorless creature.

**_Fey Soothsayers_**. Korrigan are said to be able to predict the future, and sometimes a mortal will brave the perils of the forest-and potential humiliation at the korrigan's hands-to seek its advice before making an important decision.
