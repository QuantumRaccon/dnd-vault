## Description
---
_The thick-skinned, staff-wielding trollkin shaman barks rough orders to her brutish bodyguards in their guttural language. The trollkin grunts level their spears and growl menacingly._

**_Guardians of the Lair_**. While the raiding bands of the trollkins pillage for their livelihood, the trollkin shaman and its grunts protect hearth and home, securing the base against other raiders. The shaman's spells and affinity for beasts of the natural world help it maintain its status.
