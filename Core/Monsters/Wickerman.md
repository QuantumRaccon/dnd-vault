## Description
---
_A burning effigy lumbers across the open plains. It belches black smoke with every step it takes, and the tortured screams of the humanoids inside it fill the air._

**_Empowered by Sacrifice_**. In ancient times, the druids of the flame burned people alive in giant wickermen as sacrifices to the gods. The druids soon discovered a strange phenomenon when they burned the wickermen: the sacrifices' souls were trapped within the construct, filling it with rage. The druids of the flame learned to control the wickerman's rage and turned their sacrifice into a weapon of war.
**_Staff of Willow_**. A branch of the willow tree used to create the wickerman is formed into a staff, carved with runes, and conditioned with incense. The wielder can control a wickerman as long as it is within 120 feet of the wickerman and must use its action to command the wickerman to take an action.
**_Construct Nature_**. The wickerman doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
