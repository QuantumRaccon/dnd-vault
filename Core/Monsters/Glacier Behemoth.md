## Description
---
>A depression in the ground trails in the wake of this six-legged creature. Aged ice, appearing more like granite, covers the creature's body.

**_Slow but Steady_**. Glacier behemoths earn their name from their resemblance to glaciers, including their slow, relentless pace. Their squat frames help conceal their six legs, reinforcing the notion that they are calved glaciers. Short of chasms blocking its way or the intervention of other glacier behemoths, nothing can stop a glacier behemoth when it moves. Its tough hide combined with its primal intellect render it fearless as it lumbers after its foes.

**_Bulettekin_**. Glacier behemoths are arctic relatives to bulettes, but their existence predates their temperate landâ€“inhabiting kin. They are just as aggressive as their smaller cousins, but they don't have the speed or agility bulettes possess. They are also not as particular about the type of food they eat, owing to the lack of choice in the barren lands they inhabit.

**_Path of Destruction_**. Weighing at least 15 tons, a glacier behemoth can't help but crush everything in its wake. It leaves deep furrows in the ground as wide as its body. A sure sign of a wandering glacier behemoth is a crisscrossing set of ditches.
Despite its lack of stealth, a glacier behemoth can still take a settlement by surprise thanks to its ability to dig through the earth. The behemoth burrows into a building through the floor and attacks anything it finds. After this initial assault, it devastates the rest of the settlement, picking off those foolish enough to stay and fight.
