## Description
---
Many types of beetles inhabit the world, and, depending on the location and culture, they are used as food, companions, or beasts of burden by its people.
**_Underworld Beetles_**. Lantern and sniffer beetles live in the Underworld and feast primarily on the fungus that grows in the darkest caverns. The glow of the lantern beetle's abdomen is from the digestion of bioluminescent fungus, which reacts with the beetle's gut to make the glow. Both lantern and sniffer beetles are docile, and they're often trained by denizens of the Underworld as mobile light sources or for detecting particular scents.

**_Companions and Familiars_**. Lantern and sniffer beetles can be called to serve a spellcaster via the [[find familiar]] spell. The sniffer beetle sees a variety of uses on the surface world, with its most common use being as the eyes and nose for wizards with limited vision.
