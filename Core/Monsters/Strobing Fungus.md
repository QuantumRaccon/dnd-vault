## Description
---
>This creature is translucent with a white core and is composed of a narrow stalk topped with a bulbous head. It suddenly emits a powerfully bright light, then flashes bright and dark in rapid succession.

**_Chemical Warrior_**. The strobing fungus' body houses chemicals that, when mixed together, cause it to shine brighter than a torch. It also uses those chemicals for self-defense. When it senses danger, it mixes the chemicals inside a pouch within its body and secretes the mixture, which it can then shoot at the creature threatening it. Once exposed to the open air, the chemicals become highly corrosive and toxic.

**_Wandering Mushroom_**. Unlike many fungi, the strobing fungus is able to move, albeit at a slow pace. It does this by severing the portion of its base anchoring it in place and secreting some of the chemicals within its body to help it glide along to a new location. When it has reached its intended destination, it stops secreting the chemical, its movement stops, and the creature quickly attaches to the ground at the new location.

**_Popular Guards_**. Strobing fungi are often employed as guardians, particularly by creatures that have [[blindsight]]. The fungi understand rudimentary Common and can obey commands not to attack their master's allies. They typically assume anyone who has not been specifically introduced to them is an enemy and behave accordingly.
