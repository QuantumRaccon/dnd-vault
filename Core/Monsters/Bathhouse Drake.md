## Description
---
_A drake the size of a large mastiff stares at the gathered bathers with a firm gaze then lets out a breath of steam, moisturizing their skin._

Creatures of unknown origin, bathhouse drakes are a welcome sight to those who desire a relaxing sabbatical for the right price.

**_Unknown Origin_**. No one is certain how the bathhouse drakes came to be. Some theorize they were bred from other drakes to get a more tolerant and social temperament, while others speculate they might have migrated from some very distant jungle or rainforest. Another possible theory suggests they originated somewhere within the inner planes, where fire meets water. The drakes themselves, if they know, do not speak of it.


**_Lords of Luxury_**. Bathhouse drakes are curiosities of the world, serving as often as being served. Their lairs are not the dangerous caves of many true dragons, but instead the wondrous marble bathhouses of their namesake. They invest treasure from their hoards and hire artisans to create the most artistic and functional bathhouses, drawing in customers and appeasing their own egos. Some truly ambitious bathhouse drakes invest in constructing additions such as inns and taverns into their "lairs," and some even hire masseurs and chefs to serve guests and, of course, the drakes themselves.


**_Firm Yet Fair_**. While they possess the arrogance of their more ferocious draconic cousins, bathhouse drakes treat their subordinates (typica[[Core/Monsters/Kobold \|kobolds]] respect, rarely abusing and sometimes rewarding them. Though the prices of their services are high, they personally insure that they give only the best, for they understand such quality customer care is a reflection of themselves.
