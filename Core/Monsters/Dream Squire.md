## Description
---
_Dressed in fine black and silver livery, this young-looking figure sports an embroidered coat of arms on its tabard. Upon closer inspection, the figure is pale and drawn with black hair and dark smears beneath its eyes.._

Dream squires are fey servants and bodyguards commonly found in service to shadow fey nobility. A shrinking, servile thing, a dream squire lurks in the shadows near its master, awaiting its master's whim.

**_Taken and Bound_**. Perhaps it was a broken promise, a foolish deal made in haste, or punishment for offending a fey lord, but a dream squire was once a mortal man or woman who ran afoul of the fey. The fey took the mortal and transformed it into a fey creature. The freshly-minted squire is then bound to unflinchingly serve its new master.


**_Conscripted_**. A dream squire is a tireless servant, forsaking refreshment and rest to serve its master's will. The squire often looks bedraggled and exhausted, though it keeps its clothing and equipment in top repair and cleanliness, so as not to embarrass its master.


**_Tireless Nature_**. A dream squire doesn't require drink, food, or sleep.


> [!INFO] Dream Squires in Midgard
>Dream squires are most often bound in service to the shadow fey, and sometimes to the elves of the Summer Lands or a priestess of Marena. They exist in great numbers in the fey courts of the Shadow Realm and are infrequently seen on the streets of Bemmea, Cronepisht, or Zobeck, attending or running some errand for their shadow fey masters.
