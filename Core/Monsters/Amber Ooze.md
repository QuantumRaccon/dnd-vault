## Description
---
>Meandering through forests, this ooze is made from the ancient sap that comes from magical trees. Small birds and rodents float in the sap, perfectly preserved.

**_Arboreal Origins_**. With magical trees comes magical sap. An amber ooze is created when a magical tree, usually a treant, is felled or drained of its sap. Most amber oozes are large, orange blobs of sap that pick up anything they come across.

**_Preserved Innards_**. While most oozes are made of corrosive materials and dissolve their prey, the amber ooze subsists on dead plant matter and preserves animals inside it. Though unintelligent, amber oozes contain a portion of their progenitor tree's desire to protect life in the forest. If an amber ooze comes across a living creature, it immediately attempts to engulf the creature to preserve it.

**_Ooze Nature_**. An amber ooze doesn't require sleep.
