## Description
---
>Wooden roots twist together to create a towering spindle draped in a cloak of verdant leaves. An impossibly large pumpkin carved with a twisted smile crowns the figure.

**_Lord of Harvest_**. The Pumpkin King is a minor fey lord who rules over bountiful harvest, particularly in the autumnal seasons before snow blankets the world. The Pumpkin King can make a region flourish, changing barren farms and struggling villages into fruitful locales with a single blessing.

**_Unknown Deal_**. The Pumpkin King listens from their hidden patch in the lands of the fey, waiting to hear the desperate pleas of struggling farmers and starving villagers. Once the Pumpkin King hears such a request, they place their blessing upon the land, bringing ten years of prosperity. What the farmers do not know is that upon the moonrise of the tenth year, the Pumpkin King returns to collect the promised share of the harvest.
