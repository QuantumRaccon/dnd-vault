## Description
---
_The karakura is a creature of haze and shadow, its hypnotic presence often overpowering._

**_Charismatic Predators_**. Karakura are vampiric fiends that use their wit and charm to draw in prey rather than chase it down. They prefer to charm mortals and feed upon devotion and love, though flesh and blood will do in a pinch.

**_Corruptors for the Cause_**. Karakura often serve demon lords who direct them to seduce and corrupt mortals. As a mortal falls under the fiendish influence, a taint spreads upon its soul. It is transformed into a mane when it dies, which provides sustenance for the demon lords. The karakura regularly serve [[Alquam, Demon Lord of Night \|Alquam, the Demon Lord of Night]] (Tome of Beasts), and his realm serves as a home to many karakura.
