## Description
---
>The curious bipedal lizard lets out a musical chirp. More chirps respond from within the nearby grass, becoming a sinister chorus.

[[Compsognathus]] is one of the smallest carnivorous dinosaurs. Its stature leads many to underestimate the deadly nature of a pack of these beasts.
**_Kobold Pets_**. Compsognathus are often kept by kobolds as pets. Kobolds are particularly fond of building traps that feed swarms of the dinosaurs by placing them at the bottom of a hidden pit or rigging a cage full of the creatures to drop on the heads of unsuspecting adventurers.

**_Little Dinosaurs, Big Appetites_**. Though compsognathus are small, they live in large packs. Compsognathus are not afraid of larger prey when they hunt together as a swarm and will seek out a meal worthy of the pack.

**_Silently Surrounds_**. Compsognathus are naturally stealthy thanks to their size and ability to blend in with natural terrain. They hunt in tall grass or areas of dense foliage, spreading out to surround their prey before attacking.
