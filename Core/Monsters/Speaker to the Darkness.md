## Description
---
_Guano stains the bat fur robe and flayed-skin cloak of this creature. Its mustache is braided with beads of carved bone and its balding head is circled in straw-like white hair._

The speaker to the darkness wears a mask and a cloak of flayed skin over a robe of bat fur. Its bare feet are caked with dried guano, while its clothing is spattered with fresher samples.

**_Priest of Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats_**. The speaker to the darkness oversees the religious aspects of the derro bat cult, leading rituals and sacrifices, consulting with [[Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire \|Lord Camazotz]] (Tome of Beasts), and organizing expeditions to the surface for prisoners. It often squabbles with other derro priests and leaders over how to divide such prisoners between them. The howling winds of the outer dark soothe its troubled mind, reminding it of the great destiny before it and its ultimate gift to its [[Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire \|Lord Camazotz]]: eternal darkness.
