## Description
---
_This goat-legged creature has green or brown skin, dirty ivory tusks, and black eyes that burn red in the dark. It considers frogs and worms treats, and the creature has a leather pouch stuffed with both._

The kallikantzaros are dark fey creatures that dwell deep beneath the surface of the mortal world, along the trunk of Yggdrasil, the World Tree. Every day, the kallikantzaros work to saw down Yggdrasil, though who set them to this task has been forgotten by even them.

**_Solstice Marauders_**. Each year, as the kallikantzaros draw close to succeeding in their purpose, the winter solstice arrives, a 12-day period where the kallikantzaros may cross over to the surface world to harass those who dwell there. Each year, the kallikantzaros are compelled to the surface to terrorize and plunder. And each year, upon returning to their lair, they are enraged to find that the World Tree has been healed.


**_Goblin Confusion_**. With their greenish skin and pointed ears, the kallikantzaros are often mistaken for goblins or dust goblins. This drives most of them into a fury, as they insist they share nothing with "worthless, lazy, foolish" goblins. Many will insist on an immediate and profuse apology or a duel to settle the point.
