## Description
---
_An enormous viper formed of green liquid curls upward, its dripping fangs ready to strike._

**_The Queen's Servants_**. Servants of the [[Queen of Serpents]], venom elementals are summoned from the demiplane of poisons. Venom elementals resemble water elementals but almost always take the form of a snake with prominent fangs.


**_Willing Visitors_**. Unlike other elementals, these creatures crave summoning to the Material Plane, where they can observe the effects of their bites on living creatures.


**_Elemental Nature_**. The venom elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


> [!INFO] Conjuring Blood and Venom Elementals
>Conjuring a venom elemental or a blood elemental is similar to summoning a water elementalâ€”with a few particular changes. For both types, the spell has the same casting time, range, and duration. For a venom elemental, the water and sand used as material components are replaced by water and venom taken from a giant spider or snake within the last 3 days. For a blood elemental, the material component is salt water with at least 1 gallon of fresh, uncongealed blood added to it.
