## Description
---
>The small snake slithers forward. As it nears a door, spectral hands appear all around it, opening and pushing the door to allow the snake entry.

**_Pet Project_**. Thieves' guilds with magically inclined members often imbue particularly crafty snakes with keen intelligence, telepathy, and the ability to summon dozens of mage hands to aid the guild. The small, stealthy creatures are capable of carrying out heists that are logistically impractical for humanoids due to their bulk. Predictably, the clever reptiles often escape their creators and carve out small territories for themselves in the more disreputable parts of cities where their true identities won't easily be discovered.

**_Mischievous Thieves_**. Snakes with a hundred mage hands are known for their mischievous nature. Many are kleptomaniacs and swindlers, using their talents to deceive humanoids and steal objects they find pleasing.
