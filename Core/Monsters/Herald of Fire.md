## Description
---
_Boasting shining, golden claws and crimson robes and smelling of smoke and ash, the bipedal dragon strode through the burning city, pointing its golden claw at certain homes and businesses. In each place, the soldiers found golden plunder to load on the wagons._

The herald of fire is a living embodiment of fiery justice and burnt sacrifices to the draconic gods. In most cases, the herald appears when some great sacrilege has been committed against the faith of fire, such as the withholding of taxes and tribute, or the slaughter of dragons and their kin, or desecration of a temple.

**_Fiery Eyes and Magical Sword_**. Though the herald can assume the shape of a dragonborn, human, or kobold, it always has eyes filled with leaping flames, no matter its guise. This is far more obvious by night than in daylight. The herald often carries a magical sword of truth. It rarely uses this weapon in battle, for it is made of soft silver and inlaid with mithral and gold. However, all those near the sword find it quite difficult to lie.


**_Quick to Anger_**. While a herald of fire does seek justice and tribute for the dragon gods, it is known for its propensity to anger at slight provocations. In many cases, its anger leads it to shout, stamp its clawed feet, or smash objects around it. In a few cases, it performs immediate and even fatal judgment on the source of its annoyance. Afterwards, it generally claims to have acted entirely within the law and dares others to gainsay it.
