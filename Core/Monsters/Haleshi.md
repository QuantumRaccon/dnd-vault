## Description

>A tall, gangly humanoid creature with pale-green skin and the head of a mackerel strides out of the water. It wears a loose-fitting tunic and carries a clamshell in its long, spindly hands.

**_Diplomatic Fey_**. Haleshi are fey that act as intermediaries between fey who live on the land and those who live in oceans and rivers, settling disputes that arise between the two groups. Haleshi are impartial in their rulings and prefer to make decisions based on evidence rather than rumor and speculation. The job of an haleshi is a difficult one due to the chaotic and unpredictable nature of many fey, but they usually receive the backing of the fey lords, particularly the [[River King]] (Tome of Beasts), whose court they frequent, and the [[Bear King]] (Tome of Beasts), who admires their stoic adherence to duty in the face of adversity.

**_Clam Riders_**. Haleshi have a mystical connection with ordinary clams and similar mollusks and are able to use mollusks to magically transport themselves from one body of water to another.

**_Food-Lovers_**. While haleshi have little to do with humanoids in their role as fey diplomats and judges, they have a predilection for human and elven cuisine, particularly desserts such as apple pies and strawberry tartlets. Some fey try to bribe haleshi with human or elven sweets, only to find that the fey are all but incorruptible.
