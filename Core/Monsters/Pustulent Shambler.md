## Description
---
>Piles of dissolved bones, seemingly eaten away by acid, encircle this mound of quivering, pus-covered flesh.

**_Dissolvers of Bone_**. Crawling heaps of diseased flesh, pustulent shamblers possess a corrosive material that eats away at bone matter.

**_Keepers of Macabre Larders_**. Pustulent shamblers drag victims of [[bonerot]] to their lairs to feed on the boneless flesh. Though they idly devour their victims, they have enough awareness of potential retribution to keep a few corpses available to quickly heal themselves.

**_Connected to Bonerot_**. Pustulent shamblers have a preternatural link to the disease they inflict. This allows them to track escaping victims and be present when the disease overtakes their prey.

**_Ooze Nature_**. The pustulent shambler doesn't require sleep.
