## Description
---
_A strange amalgam of creatures, the antlered rabbit hops on the stump, spreading its wings and releasing a high-pitched shriek from behind its fangs._

**_Mischievous Beasts_**.  The wolpertinger possesses a talent for mischief and petty theft involving food but otherwise does little harm if unprovoked. An angry wolpertinger, on the other hand, makes for a frightening enemy, dropping from the sky, antlers first, on the object of its ire.

**_Desired by Fey_**. Some fey develop unusual compulsions around wolpertingers, describing them as divinely adorable, delightful, and utterly charming. While wolpertingers are certainly unusual, the fey often become obsessed enough to pay large sums for a live animal. Bearfolk consider them reliable guides through forests, claiming they can speak. No other humanoids have reported wolpertinger speech, and it seems likely that the bearfolk may be teasing their fey and gnomish friends.

**_Gnome Friends_**. Wolpertingers have a fondness for gnomes and dwell in forests near gnomish settlements. Gnomes often raise wolpertingers as companions and many gnomish wizards have wolpertinger familiars.

> [!INFO] Wolpertinger Familiars
>Some wolpertingers are willing to serve spellcasters as a familiar. Such wolpertingers have the following trait.
**_Familiar_**. The wolpertinger can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the wolpertinger senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the wolpertinger is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the wolpertinger's Standing Leap trait. At any time and for any reason, the wolpertinger can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
