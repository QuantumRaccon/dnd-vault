**_Cursed Nature_**. Hantu penanggal arise when creatures pledged to fiendish powers break their agreements. They are cursed, becoming fiends hungering for the flesh and blood of the innocent.

**_Mistaken for Undead_**. Hantu penanggal are often mistaken for undead and don't correct this error, finding delight in taking advantage of adventurers ill-prepared for an encounter with a fiend.
