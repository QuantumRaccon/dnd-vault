## Description
---
>This diminutive, bipedal creature has large, black eyes, rubbery gray skin, a protruding belly, and vicious claws. It appears to lack ears and a nose.

**_Allies of the Ghasts of Leng_**. Semas are small creatures from the Plateau of Leng, and they are commonly found in the company of ghasts of Leng and [[kaveph]], acting as pets toward the larger creatures. Semas are loyal to the ghasts, going so far as to defend their threatened masters. Likewise, the ghasts are always sure to throw the semas a few scraps of meat during the ghasts' notorious feeding frenzies.

**_At Home in the Dark_**. Semas have extremely sensitive eyes and prefer to live in dark places. They find excessive amounts of light distasteful, and in open sunlight they are known to keen, howl, and clutch at their hairless heads as if the very presence of the light causes them pain. They immediately calm down once they make their way into darkness.

**_Gleeful Bloodlust_**. Semas are much like wild predators, seeming to take great joy in jumping out of the darkness and spilling blood. They are inherently cruel, and their own physical pain seems to mean little to them. They participate in the feeding frenzies of the ghasts of Leng even when they are more than capable of finding their own prey.
