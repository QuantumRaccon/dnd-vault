## Description
---
>A multi-headed horror tears out of the body of this tusked, ogrelike brute.

Manggus are ogre-like shapeshifters that join with tribes of trolls, ogres, trollkin, and other giant races.
**_Dominated Tribe_**. Once a manggus has been accepted into a tribe, it works its way up, eventually becoming the tribe's leader through intimidation, fear, and the threat of barbaric punishments. The most successful manggus even gather multiple tribes together, uniting the different races into warbands that sweep across the land.

**_Rending Transformation_**. When the manggus changes shape its new form rips through the body of the previous one, an act usually accompanied by a great deal of blood and gore. The pain of the transformation fuels the manggus' rage, which it lets out in a mighty roar.
