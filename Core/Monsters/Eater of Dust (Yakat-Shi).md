## Description
---
_This terrible creature resembles an imposing knight wearing baroque plate armor made of calcified resin. Its helm is a blank gray oval without eye slots or mouthpiece, and it carries a glistening greatsword with one or more slavering, fanged mouths._

Eaters of dust can consume just about anything with their horrible animate mawblades, including most gems and metals, but they prefer the flesh and souls of mortals to any other form of payment.

**_Mercenary Companies_**. Eaters of dust—or yakat-shi as they are sometimes called in ancient planar texts—roam the lower planes selling their services to arch-devils, demon lords, and other fiendish rulers for the chance to sample new flavors and devour interesting morsels. Eaters of dust often operate in small but deadly military units led by a powerful leader, styled the yakat-norog.

**_Armor Shell_**. While many sages confuse eaters of dust for some obscure variety of fiend, they are aberrations escaped from a far-flung dimension of madness and nightmares. Indeed, their armor is not armor at all, but a secreted resin that hardens into a shell as strong as steel. When cracked, it exudes a nacreous blood, and the resulting scar resembles mother-of-pearl. Heavily scarred eaters of dust seem to have a huge number of such mother-of-pearl inlays, but these are all marks of wounds they have survived.

**_Destroy Magic_**. Eaters of dust take particular delight in destroying and devouring powerful magical weapons and armor, especially intelligent or holy weapons, and charge recklessly into battle against opponents wielding such delicious viands. They are have nothing but contempt for most other life forms, attacking and eating their allies at the first sign of weakness.
A typical eater of dust is 7 feet tall and weighs more than 350 lb. While an eater of dust cannot speak, it can telepathically communicate with almost any creature.
