## Description

>A rivulet of lava streams from a cavity between the shoulders of this four-armed, volcanic creature.

**_Volcanic Guardians_**. Lava keepers are elementals from the borderlands between the Elemental Planes of Earth and Fire. They sometimes emerge onto the Material Plane through spontaneous elemental vortices in the hearts of volcanoes. Once on the Material Plane, they find themselves trapped. Instead of running rampant, they act as guardians for the region from which they emerged in the hopes that one day they can return home.

**_Noble Elementals_**. Lava keepers are the natural enemies of salamanders and other chaotic elementals. They feel a mixture of shame and pity toward their corrupted brethren, the [[cherufe \|cherufes]], and go out of their way to put an end to any cherufes they encounter.

**_Gods of the Mount_**. Lava keepers are sometimes worshiped by primitive humanoids living in volcanic regions. These humanoids offer the lava keeper tribute, and, in return, the lava keeper drives off harmful monsters and directs lava flows in ways that promote new life and maintain healthy soil. The two sides rarely possess the means to communicate with one another, and the lava keeper often has little understanding of the tribe's true goals or motivations. While not evil, the lava keeper does not have the same concept of life as most humanoids and seldom intervenes in the sacrifice of a living creature. However, stories abound of sacrifices being saved by their lava keepers after the two discovered they could speak with each other.

**_Elemental Nature_**. The lava keeper doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
