## Description
---
>The butcher strides down the lane, preaching of threshing the chaff from the wheat. Around it, people tear into each other, blind with rage. All the while, the butcher grows in stature and sprouts wicked horns as it revels in the massacre.

Heralds of slaughter are sent by dark gods to foment unrest and agitate mortals into committing barbaric atrocities.
**_Provokers of Wrath_**. Disguised as a trusted craftsman, a herald of slaughter finds a source of anger in a community and feeds it until it grows, all while pretending to understand and offer solutions to the source. A herald of slaughter fuels the anger of the people by instigating mass culling, revolts, and blood sacrifices. As problems escalate, a herald of slaughter reveals its fiendish form to culminate the savagery in a final, chaotic exaltation of the dark gods.

**_Brutality and Blood_**. Once a herald of slaughter has been revealed, it assumes its fiendish appearance and wades fanatically into combat. Wielding a massive meat cleaver and rage-inducing magic, a herald of slaughter seeks to destabilize its opponents by inciting blinding fury and pitting comrades against each other.
