## Description
---
_Black pustules cover a shambling corpse. The zombie lets out a baleful moan, breathing a cloud of black spores._

Mold zombies are undead created by necromantic spores. They serve no masters and have no desires other than spreading their infection.

**_Spore Infection_**. Mold zombies are created when a humanoid inhales the spores of an iumenta flower, a red-vined, black-petaled swamp plant that smells of rotting flesh. Once inhaled, the host contracts iumenta pox. The spores quickly shut down internal organs while growing into the muscles and the brain. When the host dies, the spores reanimate the corpse into a mold zombie.

**_Spread the Spores_**. Mold zombies are controlled by their spores, which seek to infect more humanoids. When a zombie sees a potential host, it fights to the death, hoping to kill infected creatures so it can immediately rise as an undead. Mold zombies attract other mold zombies and move in large groups.

**_Undead Nature_**. The mold zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep
