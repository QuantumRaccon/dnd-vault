## Description
---
_With prodigious, upward-curving tusks and blood-red skin, this ogre looks even more bestial than the rest of its race. Veins stand out over its heavily-muscled body, and its eyes display a madness beyond the promise of cruelty and stupidity inherent in its fellows._

**_Few in Number_**. Profane magical experimentation produced the tusked crimson ogres long ago, though they possess the capability to breed among themselves and their ogre kin. Seldom do they appear in great numbers due to their ferocity and utter lack of fear.

**_Shunned by Normal Ogres_**. Other ogres have learned, for all their dimwittedness, to let tusked crimson ogres have their way, as a means of self-preservation.

> [!INFO] Tusked Crimson Ogres in Midgard
>A creation of the cult known as the Sanguine Path, tusked crimson ogres became widely known in the expansionist wars of the Mharoti Dragon Empire, who employ the brutes as shock troops. Bred for war by the blood mages of Kaa'nesh, the tusked crimson ogres' bloodthirsty natures receive constant reinforcement through cult indoctrination. The ogres often bathe in blood before battle, which they believe makes them more powerful, offers them protection, and guarantees them an afterlife of joyous slaughter should they fall to the enemy.
