## Description
---
_A tick, bloated to the size of a child's head, buries its mandibles deep in its victim. Circles of necrotic flesh bubble around the wound._

**_Zombie Hosts_**. Necrotic ticks are normal ticks that have gorged themselves on blood rich with necrotic energy. They grow unnaturally large as they feed, weighing in excess of four pounds when fully engorged. Most begin their voracious lives attached to the backs of animal zombies, and it is not uncommon to find a cluster of them on a single animal.

**_Death Bite_**. When the blood of a necrotic tick's undead host runs dry, the parasite rides its victim to a new hostâ€”usually an unfortunate living creature. As it sucks the living creature's blood, it leaks necrotic energy into the bite wound and starts a process that slowly turns the hapless victim into a zombie one pound of flesh at a time. If no potential hosts are available, ridden hosts hide in dark crevices or in trees, where they wait to pounce on the next passerby and deliver their crawling passengers.
