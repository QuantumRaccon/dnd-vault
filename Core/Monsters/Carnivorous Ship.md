## Description

>The prow of the ship opens into a gigantic, tooth-filled maw, while humanoid-shaped blobs of flesh swarm over the rails.

**_Bribable_**. A giant cousin to the mimic, the carnivorous ship is a cunning hunter of the seas. Wise captains traveling through known carnivorous ship hunting grounds carry tithes and offerings to placate the creatures.

**_Solitary Ship Eaters_**. Carnivorous ships live and hunt alone. Though they prefer to consume wood, metal, rope, and cloth, they aren't above eating flesh and readily eat entire ships, crew and all. They reproduce asexually after a season of particularly successful hunts. Young carnivorous ships are about the size of rowboats and use the statistics of a [[mimic]], except they also have one drone. As they age, they grow in size, eventually gaining more drones.

**_Drones_**. Carnivorous ships create vaguely humanoid drones from the flesh of their bodies. These drones are mindless and act under the mental direction of the carnivorous ship. From a distance, the drones appear to be a crew as they move about the deck of the carnivorous ship, but closer inspection reveals their true nature. When the carnivorous ship attacks another ship at sea, the drones swarm over the rails onto the target ship and take down the crew that would stop the carnivorous ship from enjoying its meal.
