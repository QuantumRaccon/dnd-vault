## Description
---
_Though all darakhul acknowledge dark gods, the priestess holds a closer link than most—always first to the feast, dividing out the choice morsels, intoning the words of hideous praise for the feast._

An emissary of the Hunger God, the darakhul high priestess summons her ever-ravenous people to the feast. Leading rites of slaughter and gluttony or handing out punishments and oaths of deprivation, she exercises a great deal of control over her charges.

**_Bone Cracking_**. The marrow is considered a delicacy among the darakhul—difficult to reach, rich in flavor. The high priestess traditionally awards the first marrow bone to the altar or cracks it herself on a battlefield, shouting a note of praise (literally, "blessed marrow") during this ritual.


**_Vestments and Knives_**. The unholy garments of a darakhul priestess vary wildly in style, from formal robes stitched with black thread and set with garnet and rubies, to the more practical sacrificial robes of tooled leather, which resemble a butcher's apron. A priestess of the darakhul always carries a ritual flensing knife; it is never used in combat, only in the aftermath.


**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The darakhul doesn't require air or sleep.
