## Description
---
_A duskthorn dryad is a striking woman with obvious fey features and skin the color of slate, often found in the shade of an ancient tree. Clothed in vines and leaves, it can be difficult to tell where one leaves off and the other begins._

**_Creeper Vine Spirits_**. Duskthorn dryads are spirits tied to thorn-bearing creeper vines. They seek out dead trees and use them as a home for their vines to cling to. They can travel through trees to escape their foes but must stay near their vines.

**_Create Guardians_**. Duskthorn dryads use their vines and the plants in their glades to defend themselves, animating enormously strong vine troll skeletons as well as ordinary skeletons, children of the briar, and other horrors. These defenders are linked to the tree and vines that animated them, are controlled by hearts within the tree. If the hearts are destroyed, the servants wither or scatter.

> [!INFO] Duskthorn Dryads in Midgard
>These dryads are commonly found near the ruins of Thorn, in the Arbonesse Forest, and in the Shadow Realms. They are close friends there to the darker fey, and are thought by some to be created from ordinary dryads drawn into the corruption of the Shadow world. Certainly their mastery of the shadow language Umbral shows their close ties to this darker world.
