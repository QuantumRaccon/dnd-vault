## Description
---
>A mechanical whir issues from this pyramid-shaped mechanism as it begins to unfold hundreds of jointed limbs. When the noise grows shrillest, alien runes alight across its golden surfaces.

**_Secret Keepers_**. The people of Leng are renowned traders, and it once occurred to a Leng inventor that knowledge is the most valuable trade good. That inventor's identity is one of the many secrets the first repository faithfully keeps. These constructs are built for the reception, transmission, and safeguarding of information, and even those that don't hold particularly coveted information still defend their charges with lethal force. Repositories sometimes hold secrets within their consciousness, a task made easier by the fact that these creatures can understand all languages. Others hold physical recordings of information within their chest cavities.

**_Master of Language_**. A repository exists to protect and trade information, and as such, it knows and can translate all languages. Its programming allows it to wield this mastery of language as a physical weapon. A repository can also use the power of language as a psychic assault, uttering words of power to attack the very minds of its enemies.

**_Right Tool for the Job_**. The chest cavity of a repository contains an extradimensional space that functions like a [[bag of holding]], granting the repository the ability to pull out any tool that may be required. Most repositories keep sets of common tools stashed inside their chests, including thieves' tools and smith's tools. Some repositories, however, are equipped with specialized tools or magic items, depending on the creatures' purpose at creation. Similarly, a repository can store anything it needs to protect in this extra-dimensional space. The repository is the only creature capable of retrieving items from this space while it is alive. When a repository is destroyed, its chest cavity becomes accessible to anyone that reaches inside its pyramidal form; however, the power holding this extradimensional space together fades after 1 hour. An object in the extradimensional space when it fades is destroyed. A creature in the extradimensional space when it fades is deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.

**_Construct Nature_**. A repository doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
