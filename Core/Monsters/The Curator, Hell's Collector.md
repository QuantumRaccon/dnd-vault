## Description
---
>Bulging eyes stare unblinkingly at you from an oversized head held up by a bone neck brace. Its mottled green skin is covered by rich robes, adorned with dozens of delicately carved cages.

**_Curious Being_**. The Curator was created through a series of improbable events. An amphibious creature fell from the Material Plane into the River Styx and, after bathing in its waters, wriggled its way to the shore. Warped by magic, the now highly-intelligent and mutated creature rose to carve out its corner of Hell. Other arch-devils regard the Curator with a mixture of fear and disgust due to this bizarre origin.

**_Soul Museum_**. Hidden among the marshes of the Lower Planes, the Curator maintains a museum of souls. It seeks unusual specimens to add to the ever-growing collection of spirits preserved in its crystalline menagerie. The Curator spends its resources finding, buying, and trading for the rarest souls trapped in the Hells. No one knows why the Curator is building the museum, though creatures from across the planes are rumored to have received invitations to view it.


> [!INFO] The Curator in Midgard
>The Curator inhabits a museum in the marshes of Archedantuss. Mammon rules the plane, but his primary concern is the accumulation of wealth. The Curator has struck a bargain with Mammon, which allows the Curator to keep its collection and museum on the shores of the River Styx in exchange for two things: the Curator must collect lesser souls for Mammon, and the Curator must glean the locations of all material treasures its curated souls kept in life. For more information on the plane of Archedantuss, see _Warlock #16: Eleven Hells_.

**_The Curator's Lair_**. The Curator's museum is a crystalline structure raised from the marshy lands fed by the River Styx. Hidden by magic, the beautiful building is nearly impossible to find without an invitation. The inside of the museum is filled with soul cages carved with luminescent runes, ice sculptures imbued with gleaming souls, and drifting spirits confined within its walls.
