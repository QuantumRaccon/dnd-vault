## Description
---
The sooze make up the bulk of the shoth's armed forces. It appears vaguely humanoid with two or three appendages capable of holding weapons or tools. Its zom sits inside its head, where the strange sphere is visible through its translucent flesh.

**_Unquestioning_**. The sooze follow the instructions of the oth and droths without hesitation. They retain some of the personality traits of their former selves, but they are eager to prove themselves and embrace their status as freshly dissolved.
