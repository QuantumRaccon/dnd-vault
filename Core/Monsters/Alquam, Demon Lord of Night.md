## Description
---
Alquam, the Silent Black, Eyes in the Night, the Dark Hunter, is the demon lord of night and the creatures that prowl it. He has a particular affinity for owls; the stryx and owl harpies are both offshoots of his influence. Any shadow or dark corner at night might carry whispers to his ears. Alquam delights in music, though his favorite songs are said to grate mortal sanity to shreds. His huffed breath reeks of carrion.

Alquam is composed mostly of darkness, with some features of a monstrous owl. He stands over 15 feet tall, and dark gray feathers with lighter speckles and bands cover his body. His head is that of a great owl with back-swept horns and massive, bulbous eyes that gleam yellow. His body is thin and such a deep black that it drinks in light. His feathery wings are long enough to wrap around his whole body.

**_Demon Lords_**. Demonic powers swarm throughout the lower planes without number. Ancient beasts fade from mortal history, only to reappear eons later when their schemes draw them back to the Material Plane.
**_Alquam's Lair_**. Alquam's lair is an immense tree in the center of a lightless layer of the Abyss. The tree is an ancient, dead snag with a massige hollow chamber in the rotting trunk.
