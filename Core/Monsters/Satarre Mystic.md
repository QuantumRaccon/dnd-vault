## Description
---
>Dressed in clean, dark robes, its claws swirling in arcane gestures, the pale reptilian sends a bolt of energy from the Void at its foes.

Satarre mystics are creatures with tight awareness of nearby living creatures' fates. They rely on magic and the ability to speak words of decay to control lesser creatures. Mystics' minds are always turned to destruction and death, though they hold their own lives more dear than that of their fellow satarres, be they non-combatant drones, rampaging [[satarre destroyer \|destroyers]], or others.
**_Easily Distracted_**. Satarre mystics are known for their ability to ponder and cogitate on larger concerns, even in the midst of a conversation with strangers or a battle with foes. Sometimes these distractions lead them to a great insight and a clever countermove; other times they are easily surprised, captured, or fooled by a shining bit of magic or an unknown arcane device.

**_Perpetual Incantations_**. Satarre mystics seem to somehow maintain a steady stream of muttered sounds. Sometimes these take a brief physical form, such as a glowing rune of destruction that circles a mystic's head or drifts from its maker and falls apart in midair.

**_Planar Lore and Tools_**. Satarre mystics are well-versed in angelic, elemental, and fiendish magic and other arcana, although they do not perform all of these themselves. They often find and use magical items looted from their victims, or command elemental or fiendish minions using [[Void Speech]].
