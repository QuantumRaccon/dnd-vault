## Description
---
>This feathered humanoid has piercing eyes, larger than normal for a humanoid's head, set around a sharp beak. Wings spread from its arms, and its feet end in wicked talons.

A wereowl is a hybrid creature usually in service to a powerful creature with dominion over flying creatures. The affinity between owls and elves means that most wereowls are elves, rather than the humans typical among other lycanthropes. The wereowl possesses the keen eyesight that is common to owls, as well as the birds' preternatural ability to fly silently. Its appetite tends toward its avian nature, and it feasts on rodents and other small mammals, usually raw and directly after a successful hunt. Its attitudes toward rodents extends to [[wererat \|wererats]] and rodent-like creatures, such as ratfolk, and it often prefers to attack such creatures to the exclusion of other foes.
