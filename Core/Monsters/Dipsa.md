## Description
---
_Except for a pair of tiny fangs, the entire body of this yellowishgreen worm looks like a ropy tangle of slime-covered tubes and puddles of mucus._

**_Anesthetic Ooze._**. Many jungle clans believe the dipsa is an eyeless snake, but it is a tubular ooze with a lethal poisonous bite. The dipsa's venom has an anesthetic quality that allows the ooze to cling to creatures and slowly turn their innards to jelly without being noticed until the victim falls down dead. Once the poison's numbing property wears off, however, victims report an agonizing sense of burning from the inside out.

**_Tiny Fangs_**. A dipsa's undulating movement evokes that of a snake as much as its serpentine form, but close examination reveals that it has neither bones nor internal organs, only tiny fangs of the same color and substance as the rest of its body. A dipsa never exceeds 1 foot in length. Its coloration oscillates between sickly hues of yellow or green.

**_Gelatinous Eggs_**. Dipsas are hermaphroditic. When two dipsas breed, they leave behind about 100 gelatinous eggs in a small puddle of highly acidic milt. A dozen become fertilized and survive long enough to hatch, after which they immediately devour the others.
