## Description
---
_The minotaur moon priestess stands at the center of the maze, raising her silver axe to the skies as the lunar light glistens off her silver horns. Behind her, the labyrinth keeper's hands and eyes begin to glow._

**_The Moon Worshippers_**. The moon is a symbol of trickery and confusion, and the minotaur moon priestess heeds the call to worship. She curses those who breach the central chamber of the labyrinth, making sure they never escape.
