## Description
---
_These long, crusty slugs sparkle like ice. A gaping hole at one end serves as a mouth, from which long tendrils emanate._

Rime worms are sometimes kept as guards by frost giants.

**_Ice Burrowers_**. The rime worm's tendrils help it to burrow through ice and snow as well absorb sustenance from prey. Their pale, almost translucent, skin is coated with ice crystals, making them difficult to spot in their snowy habitat.

**_Spray Black Ice_**. The worms are fierce hunters, and their ability to spray skewers of ice and rotting flesh makes them extremely dangerous.
