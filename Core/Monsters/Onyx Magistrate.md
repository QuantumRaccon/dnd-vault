## Description
---
>This large onyx statue looks down critically from an ornate chair. It wears long ceremonial robes and carries a scepter in one hand and an orb in the other. With a slow grinding sound, the statue animates and rises in the air, still seated in its onyx chair.

**_Grand Sculptures_**. Built to oversee great libraries, courts of law, royal houses, and the seats of government in corrupt and evil lands, onyx magistrates are intelligent constructs resembling judges, court officials, or bishops seated on massive thrones. The onyx magistrate is often placed in an area of importance such as within a great meeting hall or next to an important gate and remains motionless until it deems someone worthy of its attention or in need of punishment.

**_Judge, Jury, and Executioner_**. Onyx magistrates pursue their tasks with diligence and patience, never shirking from their responsibilities or showing pity or remorse for their actions. They never tolerate falsehoods or those seeking to cajole or intimidate them, though they have a soft spot for flattery, especially that which praises their abilities or dedication to their role. The construction of an onyx magistrate requires the binding of a [[barbed devil]] or fiend of similar power, and some onyx magistrates bear traces of their diabolical heritage in the form of smoking embers for eyes or glowing cracks covering their bodies.

**_Construct Nature_**. The onyx magistrate doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
