## Description
---


Some yugoloths have an action option that allows them to summon other yugoloths.

**_Summon Yugoloth (1/Day)_**. The yugoloth chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning.
An ultroloth has a 50 percent chance of summoning **1d6** [[mezzoloth]], **1d4** [[nycaloth]], or one ultroloth.
A summoned yugoloth appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of its summoner, acts as an ally of its summoner, and can't summon other yugoloths. The summoned yugoloth remains for 1 minute, until it or its summoner dies, or until its summoner takes a bonus action to dismiss it.
