## Description
---
_A hulking figure floats in the air, a winged horror painted in mist and moonlight._

**_Corruptors of the Moon_**. Always standing a bit apart from the machinations of the Dukes of Hell due to their dependence on moonlight, lunar devils can be found subverting druidical orders or leading packs of werewolves. They are a lazy breed of devil, and prefer lounging in the light of the moon over any more vigorous activity. The only exception is an opportunity to corrupt druids and moon-worshippers, pitting them against followers of sun gods.

**_Vain and Boastful_**. Lunar devils are as vain as they are indolent, and tales the fey tell of them involve thwarting them by appealing to their vanity. Lunar devils frequently befriend the dark fey.

**_Flying in Darkness_**. In combat, lunar devils sometimes cast [[fly]] on allies to bring them along, and they stay in areas of moonlight whenever they can. Lunar devils have excellent vision in total darkness as well, though, and are happy to use that against foes. At range, they use hurl moonlight and lightwalking to frustrate enemies. In melee, they use [[wall of ice]] to split foes, the better to battle just half at a time.

> [!INFO] Lunar Devils and the Fey
>In Midgard, lunar devils serve the Moonlit King in the Realms of the Shadow Fey and are close allies of followers of Hecate. They have some agreement with the shadow fey; the two often work together.




The devil can attempt a magical summoning. The devil has a 40 percent chance of summoning either 2 chain devils or 1 lunar devil.
