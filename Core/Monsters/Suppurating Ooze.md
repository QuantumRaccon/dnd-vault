```

## Description
---
_A sentient pool of blood and protoplasm seeps forward, the thin membrane encasing its form rippling with undulating pustules._

**_Unnatural Antibodies_**. Suppurating oozes lurk in horrible, disease-ridden places. These semiâ€‘transparent accretions of pus and coagulant are borne from the liquefied remains of victims of a disease called the Seeping Death.

**_Morbid Liquefaction_**. The contagion spread by the suppurating ooze is a radically advanced form of liquefactive necrosis and helps the ooze slowly digest its fleshy prey.

**_Ooze Nature_**. An ooze doesn't require sleep.
