## Description
---
_The large creature's rough, humanoid form is made of durable brick or stone, and its demonic face is shaped from flame._

**_Guardian of Fire_**. Certain fire cultists protect their sanctums in a surprising way. Those who seek to defile the holy altar of such cults find that it's capable of defending itself. The altar quickly takes a humanoid shape and destroys or drives out all who fail to show proper obeisance to the sacred flame, searing them with a holy inferno or crushing them with scorching fists of brick. These golems are found in larger, more important fire temples and seldom appear anywhere else.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
