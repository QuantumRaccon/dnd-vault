## Description
---
_This suit of armor stands motionless, its visor raised to reveal a black skull with eyes cold as a winter moon. A cloak of owl feathers hangs from its shoulders, and a greatsword is slung across its back._

**_Beautiful Constructs_**. Monolithic servitors are constructs designed to serve the courts of the shadow fey. As constructs go, these are uncommonly beautiful; they are meant to be as pleasing to the eyes as they are functional. Beauty, of course, is in the eye of the beholder, and what's beautiful in the eyes of the shadow fey might be considered strange, disturbing, or even alarming by mortal folk.

**_Expensive Armor_**. Regardless of a viewer's esthetic opinion, it's obvious that a monolith champion incorporates amazing workmanship. Every fitting is perfect; every surface is masterfully burnished and etched with detail almost invisible to the naked eye or decorated with macabre inlays and precious chasing. The skull in the helmet is mere decoration, meant to frighten the weak of heart and mislead opponents into thinking the champion is some form of undead rather than a pure construct.

**_Keeping Out the Rabble_**. As its name implies, the monolith champion serves as a guardian, warrior, or sentry. In those roles, it never tires, never becomes distracted or bored, never questions its loyalty, and never swerves from its duty. It delights in throwing non-fey visitors out of fey settlements and buildings.
