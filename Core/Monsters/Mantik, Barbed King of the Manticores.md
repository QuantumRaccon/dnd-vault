## Description
---
_Much larger than his kin, Mantik's scarred and wizened visage is punctuated by longsword-length teeth that grind and clatter together when he speaks. His coloration is direst crimson, and his black wings appear too withered for flight._

Inside the sandblasted walls of a ruined castle, the king of the manticores roars decrees to the wind. Mantik, the oldest and most ferocious of his kind, sits atop the shattered throne of a long-forgotten kingdom. He is loved like a god by a loyal clan of kobolds, who bring the beast treasures and sacrifices.

**_Withered Wings_**. Mantik's wings have mysteriously shrunken into two withered appendages. A kobold shaman suggested the Barbed King has come under a curse of some sort. Mantik believes divine magic is the only way to restore his ability to fly, but he is too proud to learn prayer or engage in devotion. Whatever the reason for his withered wings, Mantik bitterly plots to cure his strange affliction.

**_The Barbed_**. The kobolds who worship Mantik refer to themselves as the Barbed. They scurry around the manticore's castle like servile rats, both enamored and terrified of their ruler.

**_Covetous_**. Mantik has a substantial hoard gathered in the ruined chambers under his castle. His manticores raid the infrequent trade caravans traveling the wastes, and several times a year he embarks on treasure hunting expeditions, stalking the many scavenger bands picking through lost battlefields. His throne room is filled with ancient carvings, fractured statues, old tapestries, and jewelry-all displayed on crumbling stone pedestals or awkwardly hung from pock‑marked walls. Mantik both loves and loathes his hoard; he yearns for a castle fit to hold his treasures.

> [!INFO] Mantik in Midgard
>In Midgard, Mantik dwells in a ruined castle deep in the Red Wastes that sprawl between the Dragon Empire and Khandiria. Surrounded by his motley army, Mantik lusts for a taste of the wealth kept in the Dragoncoil Mountains and in the cities of Khandiria, starting with Isquetta. His own treasury is filled with the spoils of his raids on caravans and drake lairs. He covets the three feathers of Azuran—magical sapphires carved into the shape of crane feathers—most of all. Mantik believes the jewels will restore his ability to fly.
