## Description
---
_The length of the dragon's wingless, serpent-like body is covered in fine scales, black on one end, white on the other, blending into one another in the middle of its form._

Immortal dragons, ouroboros are symbols of both the preservation of life and the destruction of all things.

**_Cyclical Immortality_**. If slain, the ouroboros is reborn from the energy of its former body. When it rises again, its colors have swapped, and its behavior is changed. If it was destructive in its previous life, it becomes peaceful, and vice versa.
