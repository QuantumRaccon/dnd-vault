## Description
---
_These small, winter faeries are vicious and deadly. With their pale skin and translucent wings, they blend perfectly into their snowy environment; only their beady black eyes stand out against the snow and ice._

These malevolent ice-sprites are a plague upon the people of snowy climates, ambushing unwary prey with icy arrows and freezing spell-like powers.

**_Servants of the North Wind_**. Known as "patzinaki" in some dialects of Dwarvish, the beli are the servants of winter gods and venerate the north wind as Boreas and other gods of darker aspects. They are frequent allies with the fraughashar.

**_Feast Crashers_**. Beli especially delight in disrupting feasts and making off with the holiday cakesâ€”the least deadly of their malicious pranks.

**_Fear of Druids_**. They have an irrational fear of northern druids and their snow bear companions.
