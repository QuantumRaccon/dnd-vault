## Description
---
Baphomet: Demon Lord of Minotaurs and the Prince of Beasts. Worshipped by the beastial minotaurs, the ogres, and the giants. Baphomet commands an army of demonic minions from his Endless Maze within the 600th Layer of the Abyss. Three of these have served different purposes to Baphomet in his endless wars and each with their own unique abilities and characteristics.

This horrifying demon resembles a mixture of man, bat, bull, bear and crocodile. Its patchy hair reveals areas of scales, boil- covered flesh and bone on its broad, muscular frame. Despite their bulky bodies, ankashars have a pair of bat-like wings which allow them to fly in and out of combat.

**_Baphomet's Experiment_**. The first ankashar were created when Baphomet decided to create a winged mount to fly into combat. The results of this experiment were the ankashar, who quickly proved too unpredictable to be trusted as mounts, or even allies. These beasts were allowed to run feral, where they have bred into a variety of twisted forms.
**_Variable Physiology_**. Although all ankashar have similar traits (bull-like horns, wings of stretched skin, powerful tails and bulky limbs), each individual is unique. Some have clawed, reptilian feet where others have hooves. Some have the face of a tormented man whilst others bare a twisted visage of man and beast. The form of these fiends is almost as unpredictable as their behaviour.
**_Proof of Zeal_**. Occasionally, Baphomet sends an ankashar to one of his cults on the Material Plane who have beseech him to send them aid. The ankashar is just as likely to devour the cultists as it is to obey their commands, but Baphomet believes that if they fall beneath its wrath, then they were not strong enough to exist anyway.
Some ankashar carry a foul disease known as warpflesh, which causes the area bitten by an ankashar to twist and bend, becoming deformed. A creature bitten by an ankashar must succeed on a DC 15 Constiutiton saving throw against disease or contract Warpflesh. An infected creature immediately has its Dexterity score reduced by **1d4**. If this reduces the creatures Dexterity to 0, it dies.

At the end of each long rest, the creature must repeat the saving throw. On a failed save, its Dexterity score is reduced by a further **1d4**. Whilst infected by Warpflesh, a creature has disadvantage against any effect that would alter its form, such as the flesh to stone or polymorph spell.

Warpflesh can only be removed through magical healing, such as a casting of heal or remove disease.
