## Description
---
_Thick, white fur coats this hulking ursine, and massive crystalline shards of ice protrude from its shoulders. When it lets out a mighty roar, frigid breath dances between the jagged sprouts of ice that form its teeth._

A fearsome sight, the ursa polaris dwarfs even the largest of polar bears. Some believe that they are polar bears blessed or cursed by gods of cold, winter, and the north. Followers of such gods often leave a caribou carcass, whale blubber, or seal meat as an offering to the ursa polaris.

**_Creatures of Ice_**. The ursa polaris thrives in freezing arctic conditions and is capable of surviving off of ice alone, should other food sources become scarce. They dislike warmth; an ursa polaris will avoid warm waters and curl into its ice cavern when summer comes.

**_Fiercely Territorial_**. The ursa polaris is a solitary creature, carving a vast swath of territory for itself and going out of its way to kill trespassers. Somewhere within its territory, a female ursa polaris will carve out an ice cavern to rear young; this cavern may be within glacial ice, an iceberg, or simply a frosty stone cavern.

**_Hypnotically Deadly_**. The ursa polaris uses the mesmerizing play of light on the ice covering its body to hypnotize its prey for an easy kill.
