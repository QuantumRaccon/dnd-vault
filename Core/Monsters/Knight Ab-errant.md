## Description
---
>A man of supernatural physique swings his mighty hammer with the ease and abandon of a child wielding a fallen tree branch. Beneath his ruined tabard, swirling runes and sigils dance across an impossibly muscular frame.

Once ordinary warriors, these towering behemoths have been scourged by wild and unpredictable magic that lingers in forgotten and forbidden parts of the world.
**_Revised Beyond Recognition_**. Perhaps a paladin claims a trophy from an ancient and unknowable force from beyond the stars, after routing a dungeon of its followers and slowly, the trophy changes him. In the heat of combat, a simple swordsman might quaff the wrong potion and be spontaneously transformed by an errant wizard's experimental brew. Whatever their origins, they now walk the world as hulking abominations, gifted strength unimaginable in an ironic reflection of their former selves.

**_Born of Boons_**. Although many knights ab-errant may be altered after exposure to unpredictable arcane sorcery, some were created by divine magic. These may be devotees of trickster gods, or ones that are especially cruel, or they may have prayed to innocuous deities in ways that were unorthodox or otherwise wanting.


> [!INFO] Knights Ab-errant in Midgard
>A growing number of knights ab-errant have been seen aimlessly wandering the Western Wastes of Midgard, wearing the livery of the White Knights of Bourgund. Whether these individuals were transformed after exposure to the fell energies of nearby fallen magocracies, after traversing too close to the shadows of the Dread Walkers, or via the machinations of separatist mages of Bemmea who long to be free of their bonds of servitude to the knights, Bourgund seeks to eradicate these deviants that are so evidently tied to their proud realm.
