## Description
---
This statuesque woman towers over any tall man, and most ogres. Her hair falls in a cascade of curls and looks as if it is spun from copper. Her eyes are the color of moss beds, with no iris or pupil. A billowy robe of forest green enshrouds her body, and she grasps a great ring of etched silver in one massive fist.

Nicnevin the Moon Weaver is the Mountain Ogress, Lady of Copper and Crystal, the Queen of Witches. Nicnevin is not what one usually imagines in a fey lady, but she has an imposing figure of mass and power. Her stature speaks to great physical strength and the stalwart defiance of the mountain itself, but her true power is in her command of magic.

**_Pact Patron_**. The Queen of Witches is one of the foremost patrons of those who seek power through a pact. Many hag covens offer her loyalty and tribute. She rules from beneath her mountain, attended by a court of fey witches, hags, and mortal supplicants. Her favor is highly sought after, and it is said that a single hair from her coppery head contains all the power a mortal might ever desire.


**_Fey Lords and Ladies_**. Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings, but despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.
**_Heads of State_**. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's rule, in his or eyes, a fey ruler's word is law, and so shall the rest of the world see it! Outsiders may not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

**_Circles of Power_**. Each fey noble is supreme in his or her own bailiwick, and the rulers maintain a rigid hierarchy among themselves. Thee Queen of Night and Magic is undeniably the most powerful of all fey nobles, and she rules cyclically with her embittered husband, the Moonlit King. Together, the Summer and Winter monarchs rule over the entire shadow fey race. The River King is next in power, and he rules over the river elves of the Arbonesse forest. Thee Snow Queen rules among the ice, snow, and plundering reavers of the far north, as wells as commanding the obedience of the [[fraughashar]] and [[ice maiden \|ice maidens]]. The Bear King, the weakest politically, rules a northerly city-state where [[werebear \|werebears]] are common and mead flows like water.
Thee odd man out is the Lord of the Hunt. Though he is associated with both the shadow fey and the light elves, no one is certain of his true identity or how he fits into the political structure of fey nobility. Because he seldom concerns himself with politics, few have felt any need to press the question.
Other fey courts and rulers certainly exist, though their rulers are more esoteric than those described here.

**_Vacant Thrones_**. When a lord or lady dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the station of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.


> [!INFO] Touch of Iron
>Lords and ladies of the fey courts are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats. A universal exception to this is weapons of cold-wrought iron. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh. A cold iron weapon is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies.
>Cold iron weapons, however, are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficult—and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.

**_Nichnevin's Lair_**. The Queen of Witches makes her lair in a cavern deep beneath a windswept, rocky mountain. Near the mountain's peak is an enormous quartz crystal that grows down to the lair. This crystal channels the light of the moon into Nichnevin's home on nights when she doesn't emerge into the night sky. Her hags and attendant witches perform powerful rites in this magic-saturated sanctum.
