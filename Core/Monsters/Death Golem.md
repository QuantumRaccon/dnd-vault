## Description
---
The death golem is a shield guardian that has been reforged using techniques for iron golem construction, powered by necromantic magic, infusing it with a spirit from the Shadowfell. This tiny spark of death has no memory, personality, or history, it is simply the impetus to move and obey. Death golems are specifically designed to look more sinister and threatening than ordinary shield guardians.

**_Master's Amulet_**. Like a shield guardian, every death golem has an amulet magically linked to it. A death golem can have only one corresponding amulet and if that amulet is destroyed, the death golem is incapacitated until a replacement amulet is created. A death golem's amulet is subject to direct attack if it isn't being worn or carried. It has AC 10, 10 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage. Crafting an amulet requires 1 week and costs 1,000 gp in components.
A death golem's solitary focus is to protect the amulet's wearer. The amulet's wearer can command the golem to attack its enemies or to guard the wielder against attack. If an attack threatens to injure the wearer, the construct can magically absorb the blow into its own body, even at a distance.
A spellcaster can store a single spell within a death golem, which can then cast the spell on command or under specific conditions. Many a wizard has been rendered helpless by enemies, only to surprise those foes when its death golem unleashes potent magical power.
**_Magnificent Treasure_**. Because a death golem's ownership can be transferred by giving its matching amulet to another creature, some wizards collect exorbitant sums from princes, nobles, and crime lords to create death golems for them. At the same time, a death golem makes a mighty prize for anyone who slays its master and claims its amulet.
**_Torturous Origins_**. The first death golems were created by artificers held prisoner by a necromantic death cult in possession of a Manual of Iron Golems. Some of the necromancers already owned shield guardians and wanted them modified to be more fearsome and powerful. If they were to wage war against the living, they needed to have more than just control over the undead; they needed an army of powerful machines at their disposal.
After capturing two renowned artificers with advanced knowledge of constructing shield guardians, they put them to work. To keep them blindly loyal, the necromantic death cult threatened to kill the artificer's families and raise them as undead. Eventually, the artificers succeeded in their work.
**_Constructed Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
