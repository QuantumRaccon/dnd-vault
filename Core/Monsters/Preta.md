## Description
---
_The emaciated creature smacks its withered lips in hungry anticipation as it reaches out with taloned claws._

In Eastern lands when men and women huddle in their homes behind stout shutters, they know the scratch of claws upon the door heralds an unending hunger for blood. Preta appear as human-like undead with sunken, mummified skin, narrow limbs, distended bellies and wide, unblinking eyes.

**_The Hungry Ghost_**. In many traditions, the preta is a pitiful creature suffering maddening hunger that can never be sated. They are often servants to blood cultists or ghouls.


**_Blood-Drinking Trickster_**. While some only desire love or food or companionship, the dangerous preta are the ones who hunger for blood. These preta roam the countryside picking off travelers or isolated farmers. They use their invisibility and mastery of illusions to mask their approach until it is too late for their prey to flee.


**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The hungry ghost doesn't require air or sleep.
