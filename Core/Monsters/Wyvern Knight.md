## Description
---
_Clad in armor and carrying a spiked lance, the knight grips tight to the reins of its wyvern mount. The knight snarls, goading its mount forward._

For centuries, many realms have been safeguarded by knights on horseback, their advanced mobility and powerful steeds cutting through infantry lines like shears through cloth. But against the wyvern knights, even mighty cavaliers are little more than worms to be snapped up by a hungry starling. The wyvern knights are trained to ride domesticated war wyverns (see page 386), using their aerial mobility to perform countless roles on the battlefield from shattering cavalry charges to sowing chaos from behind enemy lines.

**_Baal's First_**. A group of [[elite kobold \|elite kobolds]], calling themselves Baal's First Legion, works with a dragonborn wyvern knight commander. The kobolds themselves hang onto leather straps and buckle themselves onto the commander's war wyvern for swift transport across a battlefield. As arsonists, scouts, and ambushers, they've been extremely effective.
