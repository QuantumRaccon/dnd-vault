## Description
---
_Wearing filthy hoods to hide their snouts, these small, ratlike demons squeaked with delight as they tore apart the innkeeper's cat. Everything they left behind was dead, injured, or befouled with their urine and scat._

Thoroughly gross and decadent, rattok demons sport patchy fur, sharp whiskers, notched ears, dangling charms and amulets, and long claws. They delight in manipulating souls and are fond of both necrotic energy and pure flames.

**_Servants of Chittr'k'k_**. Often called rat demons, the rattok do serve [[Chittr'k'k, Demon Lord of Rats \|Chittr'k'k, Demon Lord of Rats]], though many also serve other demons. They are greasy, sneering, smug and horrible bullies to lesser demons and enjoy tormenting those they catch. At the same time, they are complete toadies to larger and more powerful demons—though bold enough to sometimes play tricks on their masters. They spend most of their time in narrow tunnels, sewers, and caverns of the Abyss.

**_Necrotic Connoisseurs_**. Rattok demons collect, bottle, and often distill and flavor souls, trading them and generating abhorrent bottled spirits from them. These bottled souls resemble potions. Consuming a bottled soul destroys a portion of a living soul and floods the drinker's mind with some of the soul's memories.

**_Mishappen Claws, Black Hearts_**. A rattok demon's peculiar claws are a visible sign of its foulness, but its true evil lies within. Rattoks are famous as torturers, cannibals, slavers, and connivers—they constantly strive to outdo one another in vileness, and, among demonkind, they are known for their especially inventive evil deeds.
