## Description
---
>The reptilian snout peeking out from a deep hood is the only hint that this cloaked figure is a kobold. A fang charm dangling from its neck, the kobold goes about its business of secrets and whispers.

**_Agents of the Empire_**. Kobold spellclerks work primarily as messengers and agents of the Dragon Empire's spy network. They are skilled in code writing and breaking, overseeing the operations of other field agents, and providing their overlords a valued glimpse into the internal affairs of their enemies.

**_Trusted Messengers_**. Kobold spellclerks are often granted the use of magic items that aid in encryption and message-sending to supplement their natural skills and magical studies. The messages they carry or compose are often of great import to clandestine activities.

>The spellclerks operate as the lowest rank of spy in the Mharoti Empire's spy network, which is jointly administered by Parsis the Hidden and Kah Vizier Zeki Hasan Al Eski. In spite of their lower status, they are no less important to the spy network and make up the majority of Mharoti's spies abroad. At home, spellclerks are treated with a mixture of respect and wariness, as the spies are used just as often within the empire to root out those who chafe under dragon rule.
>Kobold spellclerks in Midgard typically prepare _dragon roar_ in place of [[fire bolt]] and _converse with dragon_ in place of [[feather fall]]. Both spells can be found in _Deep Magic for 5th Edition_.
