## Description
---


Some adult storm giants can channel thunderous power through their bodies and release it with a deafening stomp. This ability is represented by the following action option.

**_Thunderous Stomp {@recharge}_**. The storm giant stomps the ground, triggering a thunderclap. All other creatures within 15 feet of the giant must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or take 33 (**6d10**) thunder damage and be [[deafened]] until the start of the giant's next turn. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[deafened]]. The thunderclap can be heard out to a range of 1,200 feet.
