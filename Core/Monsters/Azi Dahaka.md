## Description
---
_The source of the bone-rattling crack of thunder reveals itself to be a three-headed dragon with black and gold scales, a long serpent-like body, and immense black wings._

**_Demonic Avatar_**. Azi Dahaka is the product of a union between a storm demon and a dragon. Scholars speculate that it may, in fact, be an avatar of an immortal demon of deceit and killing the mortal form is not enough to end the threat; the avatar will only return.
**_Sire of Storm and Swarm_**. Azi Dahaka takes delight in bringing down howling winds to cause misery and, when injured, its blood becomes rats, snakes, and stinging insects.
