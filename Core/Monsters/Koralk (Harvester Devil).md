## Description
---
_The fiendish hulk bears features taken from a nightmare scorpion, with three stinging tails and four limbs, and wields and massive scythe._

**_Shaped by Arbeyach_**. These fiendish scorpions sprang from the dark imagination of the arch-devil Arbeyach himself, who twisted them into being from the tormented forms of lemures and demoted devils. The Lord of the Swarm shaped the koralk to not only be annihilators in battle, but also to gather souls from the fallen, bypassing the typical methods of collecting souls and speeding up the influx to feed his war machine.

**_Transforming Poison_**. Poison from any one of the koralk's three stingers liquefies the target's insides in an agonizing transformation. The stung creature swells as its organs, muscle, and skeleton rapidly break down and reform. When the skin casing pops, it releases a spray of gelatinous goo and reveals the form of a lemure, the lowest form of devil. The new lemure is subject to the will of more powerful devils, and its fate from that moment on is the same as any lemure's. Eventually it will be remolded into a higher form of devil and become another warrior in service to the arch-devils and Arbeyach. Astoundingly, the koralk's poison can even work this transformation on demons, converting them to the lowest form of devil.

**_Infernal Mounts_**. A koralk is large and strong enough for Medium-size devils to ride as a mount. They don't like being used this way, but being devils, they do what they're told by their betters or suffer the consequences. Arbeyach commands an especially large specimen of koralk, called the Grand Annihilator by his devilish troops. The Prince of Swarms has been seen riding it into battle.
