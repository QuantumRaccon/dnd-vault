## Description
---
>The dragon surges through the water in a rippling mass of seaweed, flotsam, and hungry jaws.

**_Avarice and Opportunity_**. Scavengers driven by draconic instinct, kelp drakes have an eye for sunken treasure and easy food. They favor giant oysters, shipwrecked sailors, and unperceptive castaways. Never in one place for long, kelp drakes keep their hoards with them, bundled up in seaweed and scum. Tragically, they lack the intelligence to tell the difference between genuine treasure and pretty but worthless objects.

**_Drawn to Disaster_**. Kelp drakes instinctively trail along the wakes of larger oceanic creatures. After powerful monsters like [[ancient sea dragon \|sea dragons]] (Tome of Beasts), [[carnivorous ship \|carnivorous ships]], and even the mighty [[timingila]] destroy seafaring vessels and coastal settlements, a kelp drake surge soon follows. Kelp drakes prowl among the debris, even climbing up on floating derelicts to steal scraps and ambush survivors.
