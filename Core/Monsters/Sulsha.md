## Description
---
>Larger than a gorilla, this monstrous ape is covered in bright-red fur. It has twin tufts of black hair rising from its head like horns and possesses a bony spur on the end of its long, meaty tail. The creature's eyes glow with evil intelligence, and it carries a bag filled with various incendiary devices.

**_Jungle Tyrants_**. Sulshas are tyrannical simian humanoids that dwell in thick jungles, particularly in hilly or mountainous regions. Obsessed with conquering those around them, sulshas are in a constant state of warfare with creatures that share their homeland. They even force their simian cousins, such as [[kapi]] (Creature Codex) and [[vanara]] (Creature Codex), into military service to use against their enemies. Sulshas treat the smaller simians as little more than expendable resources in their grand plans. Though the [[Monkey King]] (Creature Codex) frowns on and discourages the sulshas' poor treatment of their cousins—treatment the sulshas often deny or hide from the king—he values the sulshas' strength and dedication to protecting simian kind.

**_Pyrotechnic Primates_**. Sulshas have an affinity for explosive devices. Some of their alchemists even rival those found in the largest cities, though they never take on non-simian apprentices. Every sulsha always has at least one explosive device on hand.

**_Simian Supremacy_**. Sulshas see themselves as superior to most humanoids, whom they view as physically weak and morally bankrupt. They believe vanaras to be naive and idealistic, though they respect their cousins' wisdom, and they think of kapi as simple-minded and unpredictable but still better than humans. Sulshas who think otherwise are viewed with suspicion by their community and are ultimately banished or executed.
