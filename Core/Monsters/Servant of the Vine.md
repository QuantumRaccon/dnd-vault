## Description
---
_A cheerful elf with a glass full of wine sings and dances amid the patrons at the tavern. As the evening wanes, he keeps the party goingâ€”straight out the door and into the forest._

The clergy of the elven god of wine and artistic pursuits follow their patron's edicts by spreading good cheer and inspiring art in all its forms. Their generosity is legendary when it comes to throwing spur-of-the-moment festivals, livening up listless tavern-goers, and offering openhanded patronage of the arts.

**_Fools Bearing Unwelcome Wisdom_**. The elves understand the benefits and the hazards a servant of the vine represents and indulge in the revelry and abandon that forms the god's worship with moderation and caution. This is not so easy for the shorter-lived races, however, and the arrival of a servant of the vine among non-elvish people often heralds drunken foolishness, the dissolution of marriages, acts later considered shameful, and young people "taking to the road" with no idea what might await them. For these reasons, they rarely find a warm welcome twice in the same place.


**_Artists and Vagabonds_**. A servant of the vine rarely travels alone, usually found in the company of libertine artists of varying kinds, or artistic libertines; the distinction soon blurs after a few days in the servant's company.
