## Description
---
Dressed in archaic nobleman's finery, this elf lord has wildly unkempt bluish hair and pale, almost luminous skin. His eyes bulge slightly from their sockets as they stare vacantly. The lord's shadow moves slightly out of sync with his body, which appears solid in some portions and nearly transparent in others.

His Lunar and Royal Majesty, Ludomir Imbrium the XVI, is also known as the Moonlit King of the Shadow Fey, Lord of the Shadow Realm, Lord Protector of the Black Elves, Duke of the Elf Ironcrags, Baron of Bratislor, Earl of Zobeck, Master of the Winter Palace, and Count-Palatine of Salzbach. A creature consumed by madness, the Moonlit King is an ephemeral vestige of greatness lost. He barely lives in reality anymore, and is beset by phantoms from his own mind conjured from shadows and regret.

**_Dwindling Power_**. The Moonlit King lost the favor of his wife, the Queen of Night and Magic, long ago. When he fell from power, the Queen exiled him, banishing him from his seat in the Courts of the Shadow Fey. Now he endures in the crumbling, far-flung Tower of the Moon. The King has sunk deep into madness during his isolation and has turned to bargains with demons and devils, including Alquam the Demon Lord of Night, in a desperate bid to regain freedom.


**_Fey Lords and Ladies_**. Fey are capricious, mischievous, and often dangerous beings, but despite their chaotic reputations, they do follow a certain set of rules. These rules—widely misunderstood by outsiders—are codified and enforced by a cadre of lofty fey nobility. Befitting any courtly structure, the fey bow to lords and ladies: eldritch creatures of immense power who rule the courts.
**_Heads of State_**. The fey lords and ladies are beings of high station and prodigious personal power. Each rules over at least a great city if not an entire nation. No matter the scope of a fey noble's rule, in his or eyes, a fey ruler's word is law, and so shall the rest of the world see it! Outsiders may not understand the edicts and interdicts of a fey noble, but that's no protection against the harsh penalties that await any who break them, knowingly or otherwise.

**_Circles of Power_**. Each fey noble is supreme in his or her own bailiwick, and the rulers maintain a rigid hierarchy among themselves. Thee Queen of Night and Magic is undeniably the most powerful of all fey nobles, and she rules cyclically with her embittered husband, the Moonlit King. Together, the Summer and Winter monarchs rule over the entire shadow fey race. Thee River King is next in power, and he rules over the river elves of the Arbonesse forest. Thee Snow Queen rules among the ice, snow, and plundering reavers of the far north, as wells as commanding the obedience of the [[fraughashar]] and [[ice maiden \|ice maidens]]. The Bear King, the weakest politically, rules a northerly city-state where [[werebear \|werebears]] are common and mead flows like water.
Thee odd man out is the Lord of the Hunt. Though he is associated with both the shadow fey and the light elves, no one is certain of his true identity or how he fits into the political structure of fey nobility. Because he seldom concerns himself with politics, few have felt any need to press the question.
Other fey courts and rulers certainly exist, though their rulers are more esoteric than those described here.

**_Vacant Thrones_**. When a lord or lady dies, the court does not remain leaderless for long. Ambitious beings among the fey always hunger for more power and covet the station of their superiors. After a traditional month or year of mourning, vicious power struggles winnow the weak and pave the way for the most cunning or the strongest to take the court's vacant throne.


> [!INFO] Touch of Iron
>Lords and ladies of the fey courts are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats. A universal exception to this is weapons of cold-wrought iron. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh. A cold iron weapon is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies.
>Cold iron weapons, however, are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficult—and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.

**_Moonlit King's Lair_**. The Moonlit King currently has been exiled by his wife, the Queen of Night and Magic, to the Tower of the Moon, which is hidden in a spiral labyrinth deep within the plane of shadows. The tower is a run-down, folorn place, filled with false whispers and shadow ghosts of the mad fey lord's own creation.
