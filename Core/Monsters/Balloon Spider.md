## Description
---
Honed by evolutionary processes, the balloon spider has perfected the art of ballooning, floating through the air held aloft by strands of webbing suspended by electromagnetic fields. Electrified mandibles grant these spiders precise control over nearby electromagnetic fields and a potent weapon for shocking its prey.
Beneath their hunting grounds, the corpses and bones of their prey lie sparsely coated with stray strands of blue webbing. These remains wobble and glide across the ground of their own accord, caught in stray eddies in the electromagnetic field. The webbing of a balloon spider is prized by arcanists as a component for spells and the construction of magical flying machines.
