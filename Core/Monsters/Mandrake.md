## Description
---
_A crown of lettuce-like leaves sprouts from the soil. The leaves twitch slightly, and a faint, muffled squealing can be heard from the ground._

**_Howl of Injustice_**. Though some herbalists can breed mandrakes, a mandrake only blooms in the wild under grisly circumstances: when an innocent youth is wrongfully hanged for theft, and the youth's dying blood, spittle, sweat, or urine strikes the earth. The mandrake remains dormant for one year, after which time it grows into a thick, tuberous root that is shaped like a young humanoid sprouting a thick, leafy head of hair. If the root is pulled from the ground, it wails with such piercing fury that most common folk who hear it die instantly.

**_Medicinal Marvel_**. Were it not for its incredible medicinal properties, the mandrake would never be cultivated at all. If ground into a powder and brewed for a year and a day, the mandrake root becomes an elixir of health, which can cure all poisons and afflictions.
