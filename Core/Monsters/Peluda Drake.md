## Description
---
_The drake's wedge-shaped head sits atop a long, snake-like neck. Its wingless body is covered in enormous quills._

**_War Beasts_**. Quill drakes are often tamed and trained by elves for use as beasts of war. While they do not take well to other races, they have a strange rapport with those of elven heritage.


**_Quills and Darts_**. Some tribes of jungle elves and [[cueyatl]] make use of peluda drake quills in blowguns or as speartips. The quills retain their poison for only a few days, so the tribes often keep one or more peluda as captives.


**_Root Lairs_**. Unlike most drakes, the peluda do not nest in trees or on cliffs. Instead, they dig underground dens reeking with acid and damp with steam, sometimes near hot springs or sulfurous fumaroles. Their line of acid is especially effective in close quarters, where dodging it is nearly impossible.
