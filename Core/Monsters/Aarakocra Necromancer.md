## Description
---
The aarakocra necromancer was once a leader among his tribe. His knowledge of the arcane set him above the rest and he thought very highly of himself. His ego drove him to reckless undertakings that put him and members of the tribe in danger.

**_A Dreadful Pact_**. This propensity toward recklessness is what caused the necromancer's demise. This caught the attention of Ras Nasi and he offered the necromancer a chance of being reborn as a more powerful being. In return for this, the necromancer was to help Ras Nasi in his quest for immortality by assisting the infamous lich, Acererak. Acererak was in the process of producing a device that would collect the souls of the fallen of Faerun and feed an entity that could destroy all Toril. Upon accepting the deal, the necromancer was reborn more powerful, yet once the device was created, he began to gradually lose his life force as all that are affected by the Death Curse have to deal with.
