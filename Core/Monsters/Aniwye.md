## Description
---
>The ogre shifts and contorts, dropping to all fours as it takes the form of a vicious bear-sized skunk with razor-sharp claws and teeth.

**_Noxious Terrors_**. The aniwye is a magical monstrosity that resembles a cross between an enormous skunk and a wolverine. They go out of their way to hunt humans and gnomes, particularly those tied to the natural world. Aside from their savage claws and teeth, the aniwye can also spray a deadly musk at opponents, the poison burning the eyes and lungs of those who inhale it. Aniwye also use this musk to mark their territoryâ€”a tree trunk or boulder covered in fresh musk is a sure sign an aniwye is not far away.

**_Unsubtle Shapeshifters_**. Aniwye can shapeshift into an ogre or giant, but this transformation is unstable and conspicuous. An aniwye in ogre or giant form is most often recognized by its horrible body odor and the white stripe running through its otherwise black hair. Unlike many natural shapeshifters, aniwye are unable to use these forms to deceive others for long or to ingratiate themselves into the communities of humanoids or giants. In spite of this, the aniwye's shapeshifting often allows it to get close enough to humanoids to strike with its deadly spray.

**_Hunting Comrades_**. While aniwye do not get along with most creatures, they have been known to ally with predators that share their passion for human flesh, such as [[wampus cat \|wampus cats]] (Tome of Beasts), [[gulon \|gulons]] (Creature Codex), and [[manticore \|manticores]]. Rarely, a group of aniwye will band together to take over an area, decimating the region of life and covering everything in their fetid stench.
