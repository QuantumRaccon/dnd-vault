## Description
---
>Grasping vines form this draconic creature's wings. Nettle-like teeth fill its maw, and its tail branches like a thriving plant.

**_Living Vines_**. Vines coil around and branch out from the body of the vine drake, and lengthy thorns protrude from its head and down its spine. The poison dripping from its fangs causes a severe rash on its victims. The drake uses the vines around its body to hide in its swampy home and to squeeze the life out of its prey. Despite the vine drake's plantlike nature, it is still a carnivorous dragon. It prefers deer and other game animals, but it has no problem eating the odd humanoid when it is truly hungry. In the absence of food, it can subsist, though barely, on sunlight if it spends time sunbathing.

**_Avaricious Bullies_**. Vine drakes share the typical greed possessed by most dragons and often shake down humanoids for treasure in return for safe passage through the drakes' territory. They prefer emeralds and other green precious items that blend with their coloration, and they often secret such items deep within the tangle of vines on their bodies. They usually initiate their demands by grabbing unsuspecting victims in their vines and then threatening to strangle their captured prey unless given green treasures. However, they balk at strong resistance and withdraw into undergrowth if grievously harmed or if they face opponents they can't overcome.

**_Flightless Dragons_**. Unlike most dragons, vine drakes can't fly. In their claustrophobic swampy lairs, flight is not necessary. Instead, they use their grasping vines to quickly climb and move from tree to tree to hunt or evade predators.
