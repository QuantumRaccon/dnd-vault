## Description
---
_Commonly called a whale demon by sailors, the mane of bristles around the ziphius' face gives it an almost owl-like appearance as it cuts through the water with frightening speed._

**_Easily Bribed_**. Living prey in the water quickly attracts a ziphius' attention. Many ships on routes where a ziphius is known to hunt keep a goat, sheep, or pig aboard to throw overboard as an offering if the ziphius' distinctive dorsal fin is spotted. In cases of desperation, a captive or galley slave may be substituted.

**_Huge and Extra-Huge_**. The largest reported ziphius encountered was larger than the frigate it attacked and sank. However, even the smaller ones vary between enormous and impossibly large. Most ziphius encountered are at least 75 feet long.

**_Deep Dwellers_**. The ziphius are said to have a dwelling in the deepest oceans, a place where the sahuagin, deep ones, and a few archmages are their only visitors. It is called Cruugin, a monumental stone city set with glowing jewels, in reports from the few who claim to have visited
