## Description
---
_A slick of spilled blood lurches forward as it senses nearby blood, revealing itself to be a heavy mound of sticky, crimson sludge._

**_Blood Seeking_**. Like a vampire, a blood ooze craves hot, fresh blood. It draws the blood out of its victims, leaving nothing behind but a dry and withered husk.

**_Temple Guardians_**. Blood oozes are often found as guardians of shrines, blood vaults, or temples where dark gods are propitiated with human or animal blood. The congealed remains of these sacrifices sometimes take on the dark energies of their surroundings and answer unholy prayer. In most cases, this means that they obey the directives of the temple's high priest in exchange for an occasional meal from an initiate or supplicant.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A blood ooze doesn't require sleep.
