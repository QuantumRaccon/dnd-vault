## Description
---
>The leafy creature chants as it interprets a portent in a column of roiling, acrid smoke. The little creature shouts "Woe!" while pointing a gnarled finger, signaling the other leafy creatures to rise with readied weapons.

**_Trusted Seers_**. In the gardens of the [[alliumite \|alliumites]] (Creature Codex), alliumite elders practice divination magic to guide and protect their communities. Named "garlicles" by their communities, these elders use cloves plucked from their own heads to predict the future, casting the cloves like an augur's knucklebones. The residual fey magic that infuses all alliumites sometimes causes peculiar results in a garlicle's predictions.

**_Wisdom Sought, Rarely Given_**. Desperate folk often search for garlicles, seeking answers for such things as weather forecasts, lost relics, and hidden fates. These efforts are often in vain, as alliumites turn away most petitioners. Only those who earn the title "Gardenfriend" are allowed an audience. Often, the wrathful retaliate for being rejected, but the wise garlicles are quick to negotiate peace or, failing that, prepare an apt defense.
