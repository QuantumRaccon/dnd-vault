## Description
---
>A shadow drifts gently over the castle walls, quietly sliding over its faded banners as though cast by an unseen cloud in the midday sun. A faint shimmer traces through the shade, probing its corners before settling beneath the skull of a great beast. The shadows draw inward, learning from the old bone to forge a body of glimmering void.

**_Void Dragon Offspring_**. When an [[ancient void dragon]] (Tome of Beasts) dies, some of the material composing the dragon cleaves from its body to produce liminal drakes. Though not true offspring, these drakes still possess many of the characteristics of their progenitors.

**_Planar Bodies_**. As a side effect of their origins, liminal drakes are linked to multiple planes and worlds. In an emergency, the drakes can turn themselves inside-out to pass through one of these links, escaping to safety.

**_Ominous Aurora_**. The combination of starlight and void composing a liminal drake's body is nauseating to many observers. Madness cults relish a drake's appearance in the night sky as a sure sign their dark patrons will soon arrive.

**_Void Traveler_**. The liminal drake doesn't require air, food, drink, or ambient pressure.
