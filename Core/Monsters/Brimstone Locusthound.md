## Description
---
>This creature is a disturbing combination of wolf and locust, and the smoke it exhales hovers thickly around it. Fur surrounds its locust head, and long, insectoid legs extend from its canine body.

**_Unnatural Origin_**. Brimstone locusthounds are the result of magical experimentation. Scholars are uncertain if the experiment went terribly wrong or if the creatures turned out as originally intended. The wizards who created them have been dead for thousands of years, allowing theories—and the wizards' creations—to run wild ever since.

**_Migrating Packs_**. Brimstone locusthounds build their nests below ground, in caves, or in buried ruins. They are migratory omnivores, and they prefer areas where fungi and small prey are plentiful.
Though less caring for each other than most canines, brimstone locusthounds often form packs to rear young and when food is plentiful. However, when food becomes scarce, a pack of locusthounds tears itself apart, cannibalizing its weakest members, and the survivors scatter to the wind.
