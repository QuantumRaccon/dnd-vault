## Description
---
_The figure rising from the water appears to wear a cloak made of stars, but the moonlight reveals a watery garment of black liquid. The form beneath the water is as fluid as the cloak. A blue-white skull grins from atop the body, and the staff it holds glows with green fire._

**_Undead Fey Spirits_**. Shadow river lords make their homes where dangerous rivers wear away the barrier between the mortal world and the dark fey lands. These dangerous creatures prey upon those who travel or reside near the river. A creature that dies in the river forfeits its soul to the local shadow river lord, who whisks the soul away to the fey realm to be used as currency or as a means to gain further power.

**_Shadow Skeleton Servants_**. While the souls of the victims of a shadow river lord are lost, the flesh is devoured by the river's denizens, leaving only bones. These bones are reanimated as [[shadow skeleton \|shadow skeletons]], which lurk beneath the river's surface, waiting for their master's call to action. The shadow skeletons hide within rapids or at the deepest parts of a river, hoping to pull victims down to a watery demise.

**_Undead Nature_**. A shadow river lord doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
