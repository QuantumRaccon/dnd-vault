## Description
---
_Kitsune enjoy being mysterious, elusive, and maddeningâ€”they like to have a secret or a joke at the ready. They delight in leading travelers into box canyons or deep marshes, though they are also quite witty, kind, and true to their friends._

Kitsune are fey creatures that appear as foxes with two or more tails, depending on their age; an additional tail grows every 100 years. Kitsune are grey, black, shades of brown, or auburn, until their ninth tail grows. By that time, their fur has become white or golden. Occasionally, a blue, green, or bright red kitsune is seen; these are almost always cases of a kitsune sticking itself into a dyer's vat and gaining bright and distinctive fur for a time.

**_Fashionable Humans_**. A kitsune in human form is usually quite elegant, well-dressed, and smooth. In some cases, they have a tendency to sniff for scent more than humans do; a habit from their fox form.

**_Spirit Messengers_**. Some kitsune serve particular fey or spirits of a place, such as a shrine, a stream, or a particular mountain. In these cases, they often accept sacrifices on behalf of the spirit they serve.

**_Faithful Tricksters_**. While kitsune are mischievous and enjoy playing pranks, they are loyal friends and guardians to loved ones.
