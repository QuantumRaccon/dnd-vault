## Description
---
_The risen corpses of minotaurs who died while trapped in a labyrinth of any kind, lost minotaurs embody the anguish, rage, and humiliation of the worst deaths their people can imagine._

**_Pliable Malevolence_**. Motivated by an indiscriminate malice punctuated with a relentless hatred for any who survive an encounter with them, lost minotaurs may be swayed to track and kill specific prey. What it might desire in trade varies from creature to creature, but the prize usually involves an arranged hunt of some kind.

**_Tales of Caution_**. Among minotaur communities, parents tell their children bloodcurdling tales of lost minotaurs to dissuade them from wandering into old, structurally unsound labyrinths. Tales of the nigh-unstoppable malice of these horrors find an audience most everywhere.

**_Undead Nature_**. A lost minotaur doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

> [!INFO] Lost Minotaurs in Midgard
>A large number of lost minotaurs came into being after being trapped within their fortified labyrinths and then slowly starved out or slain by gas and necrotic attacks during the Mharoti invasions of minotaur lands three centuries past. Among the minotaur diaspora on the isle of Kyprion and elsewhere, tales of lost minotaurs within the Great Labyrinth in the ruins of Roshgazi abound. Similar tales are told of the old labyrinth of Cindass, though to a lesser degree. Intrepid treasure-seekers in these crumbled places of old magic often fall to the axes of the lost minotaurs.
