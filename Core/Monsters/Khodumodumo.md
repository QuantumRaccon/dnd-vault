## Description
---
>The hillock suddenly sprouts to life, rising up from its surroundings to reveal a sightless, toad-like monster with a cavernous maw. Six long red tongues emerge from this orifice, each as thick as a man's torso and ending in a razor-sharp point.

**_The Hills Have Tongues_**. The khodumodumo is one of the apex predators of the hills and badlands in which it lives, disguising itself as a moderately-sized hillock to lure creatures closer before animating and impaling them on one of its many tongues. While not evil, the khodumodumo is a voracious predator that constantly needs to eat, and it attempts to devour just about anything that comes within reach.

**_Rite of Passage_**. Slaying a khodumodumo in single combat is often considered a rite of passage for a [[fire giant]] seeking to contest the leadership of a clan, especially because the creature is naturally resistant to fire. Powerful [[ancient red dragon \|red dragons]] have also been known to hunt khodumodumos for sport.
