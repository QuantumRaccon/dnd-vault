## Description
---
The elvish legacy lives long in its people, and the half-elven people known as the elfmarked are no different. Many try to hide their elven heritage, but their ears and the elven magic that still runs in their blood sometimes makes the deception impossible. Because of their elven blood, the elfmarked are indelibly linked to the natural magical power of the world. This link can be useful to those who train in magic, though even those elfmarked who do not train have some magical abilities. When focused properly, the elfmarked can draw upon that power to do incredible feats.

> [!INFO] Elfmarked in Midgard
>The elfmarked humans of Midgard are attuned to the ley lines that run throughout the world. They have an easier time when trying to open or travel on shadow roads, and they are more resistant to shadow corruption (see Midgard Worldbook). However, this attunement often distracts the elfmarked as the ley lines constantly thrum with energy. Elfmarked who stray too close to a powerful ley line suffer from random headaches, nosebleeds, or worse.
