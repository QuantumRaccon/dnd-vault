## Description
---
_Resembling a black-furred stag that walks like a man, this creature has a pair of immense, branching antlers arching above its coldly gleaming eyes. The fur is sleek over most of its body, but becomes shaggy around its goatlike legs. The creature's hands are tipped with wicked claws, and its legs are goatlike with cloven hooves._

**_Assume Mortal Form_**. Rubezahls are capricious creatures, driven by constantly shifting motivations and mannerisms. They are consummate tricksters who delight in taking the form of innocuous mortals like traveling monks, tinkers, or lost merchants. They love to play the friend with their nearly undetectable lies, slipping into the confidence of unsuspecting mortals before murdering them.

**_Counting Demons_**. Rubezahls have a weakness, however. They are known as counting demons, and a savvy mortal who knows its nature can confound one with groups of objects: a handful of coins, a basket of apples, even a bed of flowers. If the objects are clearly pointed out to the rubezahl, the creature becomes distracted until it counts each item in the group. Unfortunately for mortals, rebezahls can count startlingly fast; even a mound of gravel takes no more than a few moments for a rubezahl to assess. Rubezahl loathe being compelled this way, and they are equally driven to annihilate any mortal bold enough to exploit this weakness.
