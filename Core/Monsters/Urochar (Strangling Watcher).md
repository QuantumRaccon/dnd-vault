## Description
---
_This horrible gigantic crimson leech slithers upright on four muscular tentacles, each 30 feet long. At the top of its writhing trunk, a great lidless eye glows with baleful orange light, surrounded by quivering, feathered antennae fully 5 feet long._

**_Underworld Wanderers_**. The urochar are among the most dreaded monsters of the underworld. They have long plagued the drow, morlocks, and other humanoid races of the deep paths. They seek out death and the dying all the way to the banks of the River Styx.

**_Devour the Dying_**. Urochars feast on the final moments of those caught in their crushing tentacles. Though they rival the terrible neothelids in power, urochars are quite passive, watching the life and death struggles of other creatures and taking action only to drink in a dying being's final moments from a nearby crevice or overhang, and taste their final gasps of horror.

**_Immortal_**. Strangling watchers are effectively immortal. Gargantuan specimens in the deepest reaches of the underworld are several millennia old.
