## Description
---
_The chieftain's mane and hooves showed signs of long travel, the dust of the trail. But the light in his eyes was bright and the bluefeathered pike he shouldered seemed little more than a toothpick—the creature showed no sign of weariness._

Centaurs are not easily ruled. Centaur chieftains attain their status through superior strength, force of will, and a knack for sensing trouble early. All of these characteristics require frequent displays, which govern their brash, domineering approach to diplomacy.

**_Generous with Plunder_**. Centaur chieftains raid caravans, merchant carts, and small villages for fun and to win the devotion of their best warriors. The chieftains give most of the goods to the warriors as raiding is often the best way to buy centaur loyalty. Raids are especially common when a chieftain's position in a tribe is new or unstable.


**_Courting Herds_**. Humanoids accustomed to monogamous marriages and clear, permanent partnerships are often offended by centaur courting practices. Chieftains invariably retain a small courting-herd of male and female centaurs. The size of these courting-herds is as much a mark of status as anything, though outsiders often assume the herd's members are all wives or husbands to the chieftain. This assumption is incorrect as the honorable harem positions are more akin to squires, grooms, and ladies-in-waiting in a human or elven court—they dote upon the leader but are not necessarily lovers. The senior members of a courting-herd are often spouses to a centaur chieftain, though how to determine this is a puzzle to outsiders.


**_Drunken Raiding_**. While raiding can be honorable, centaur chieftains of both genders have an enormous appetite for alcohol and many are violent drunkards. This fuels their reputation as brawlers and impetuous raiders, though the chieftains who are less susceptible to bouts of drunkenness are highly regarded as leaders and mercenaries. Some chieftains turn to mercenary work largely to be paid in wine, beer, or other spirits.
