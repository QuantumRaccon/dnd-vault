## Description
---
>An enormous looking glass floats forward, its enormous, warped frame composed of writhing purple tendrils, and its surface covered in dozens of hideous, swirling eyes. Several razor-sharp whips whirl through the air around it.

**_Mirrors from Beyond_**. The helashruu are bizarre and terrifying aberrations that travel the planes, spreading chaos and destruction. Resembling towering mirrors covered in tentacles and eyes, helashruu defy rational explanation. When they deem it necessary to communicate with other creatures, it is usually through a jumbled mishmash of thoughts with their telepathy, though making sense of what they say is often next to impossible.

**_Trapping Gone Astray_**. Sages versed in planar lore believe the helashruu were created when a [[mirror of life trapping]] swallowed a powerful, deity of chaos and shattered under the strain of the energies it tried to contain. The pieces then scattered across the planes before forming into the first helashruu. The helashruu sometimes trap creatures within themselves, giving credence to this belief. Some sages hypothesize that if all the helashruu were to gather together in one place, they would reform the original mirror, and the evil entity would be released from its confinement. Thankfully, these creatures are extremely rare and hold nothing but contempt for others of their own kind.
