## Description
---
>Vaguely humanoid in appearance, this creature has long, raking claws, a jerking gait, and no facial features. Its mushroom-gray skin is covered in strange bumps and eddies as if something were seething just below the surface.

**_Faceless Nightmares_**. Dwelling on the fringes of human society in abandoned buildings, polluted thickets, and grimy backstreets, the quoreq is an aberration born from human misery and squalor, an agglomeration of negative and vile thoughts given form and motion. Though not especially picky in their choice of victims, they are empathetically drawn to creatures experiencing some form of despair or pain.

**_Emotionless Killers_**. Quoreqs do not experience emotions the same way most humanoids do and have no concept of fear or love. They do not inflict pain for simple enjoyment, instead inflicting it to share in the experience such intense emotions can produce. As they inflict pain, they often telepathically ask their victims how it feels.

**_Horrible Feeding_**. Quoreqs eat and sleep like any normal creature, but, since their mouths are concealed beneath their rigid flesh, they must use their claws to rip open their own bodies to quickly gulp down food before they can regenerate. This unusual and horrific practice lends some support to the theory that quoreqs are wholly unnatural creatures born directly from human nightmares.
