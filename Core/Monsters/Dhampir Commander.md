## Description
---
_The thin, dark-haired commander wades into the throng of enemy soldiers. The leader's troops come rushing in, inspired by the courageous example._

Dhampirs in military service fly up the ranks and use their natural charisma to inspire the soldiers beneath them to acts of heroism and violence.

**_Inspiring Leaders_**. Dhampir commanders lead by example on the battlefield, wading into combat and leading charges. A dhampir's troops die for their leader and offer their own necks for feeding if the commander is injured. Good dhampirs rely on this loyalty to fight malevolent forces, while evil half-living commanders relish the power they have over soldiers, pushing them to acts of depravity.
