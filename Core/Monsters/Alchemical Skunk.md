## Description
---
>The large skunk waddles forward, sniffing at a spilled potion. As a sound nearby startles it, the skunk raises its tail, and the stripes on its back change color.

**_Magical Prank_**. The unfortunate result of a magic school prank, alchemical skunks were created when an ordinary skunk was forced to drink a combination of potions. Despite their larger size, alchemical skunks still look and act like ordinary skunks, except for the ever-changing color of the stripes on their backs. Experienced foresters know that the colors on the alchemical skunk's back indicate which magical malady the creature is about to spray and do their best to avoid aggravating these dangerous creatures.

**_Laboratory Pests_**. Alchemical skunks forage the same as their nonmagical kin, but they are also regularly found scavenging the waste of alchemical laboratories. They enjoy feasting on potions and potion components, much to the dismay of alchemists and adventurers alike.
