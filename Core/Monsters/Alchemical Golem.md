## Description
---
_A man of solid silver plods steadily forward. Three massive tanks are embedded in its back, each sporting an adamantine needle pointing towards its metal neck._

**_Enhanced by Alchemy_**. Alchemical golems are powered not by traditional magic, but by a viscous fluid that flows through their silver bodies like blood. This alchemical slurry is potent enough on its own to power the twelve-foot-tall golem but burns with incredible power when infused with one of the three prime alchemical substances: brimstone, quicksilver, or salt. If multiple infusions are injected into the golem's vital stream at once, the mixture may become volatile.


**_Pierced by Adamantine_**. An alchemical golem's exterior can only be pierced by magical or adamantine implements. To infuse the golem with alchemical admixtures, the golem's creator has equipped its alchemical tanks with adamantine syringes.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
