## Description
---
The death barque is built in the form of a ship to combat the dangers of the seas and to spearhead naval confrontations of undead nations. Its body is constructed from hardened purple worm hides stretched taut over the ribcage of a giant subterranean shark. Its figurehead was once a [[gypsosphinx]] (Tome of Beasts) while its tail belonged to a [[adult cave dragon \|cave dragon]] (Tome of Beasts).

Death barques typically carry a dozen [[zombie \|zombies]] armed with [[glaive \|glaives]] and chained to the barque's deck with hooks through their flesh to prevent them becoming lost overboard. But it's the death barque itself that is the true threat. Its sphinxlike figurehead is capable of breathing a deadly cone of necrotic energy, and its spiked tail can launch explosive bone shards at its enemies.

**_Necrotech_**. Necromancers, both living and dead, sometimes come together to make massive undead creatures known collectively as "necrotech". In nations ruled by undead, these massive creations often act as siege weapons or powerful modes of transportation.
> [!INFO] Necrotech in Midgard
>The darakhul of the Ghoul Imperium have long practiced necromancy, using the corpses and bones of Underworld denizens to create new undead servants and devise powerful war machines to aid in their conquest of the subterranean lands. Under Emperor Nicoforus, the darakhul necromancers, known as the Necrophagi, have prospered in their mission to develop experimental necrotech, and their progress has accelerated over the last decade, thanks to the blasphemous volumes of eldritch lore gifted to the ghouls by the vampires of Morgau and Doresh in exchange for their military aid against Krakova.
