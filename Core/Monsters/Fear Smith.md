## Description
---
_Apart from their taloned hands and blank face, fear smiths appear elven. While its mouth is closed, a fear smith's face is featureless save for rows of deep wrinkles. Opening the large mouth in the center of its face reveals long needlelike teeth surrounding a single massive eye._

Known as a fiars√≠dhe among themselves, fear smiths are servants of the Court of the Shadow Fey and similar dark fey courts of such as those of Queen Mab and the Snow Queen.

**_Icy-Cold Eyes_**. Fear smiths often serve as torturers or are dispatched to demoralize the court's enemies. Their stare stops enemies cold, making it easy for heavily-armed warriors to trap and finish a foe.

**_Devour Fear_**. As their nickname suggests, fear smiths feed off strong emotions, and their favorite meal is terror. The fey prefer prolonging the death of victims, and, when free to indulge, a fear smith stalks its victim for days before attacking, hinting at its presence to build dread.

**_Hoods and Masks_**. Fear smiths favor fine clothing and high fashion, donning hooded cloaks or masks when discretion is required. Eerily well-mannered and respectful, fear smiths enjoy feigning civility and playing the part of nobility, speaking genteelly but with a thick, unidentifiable accent from within a cowl.
