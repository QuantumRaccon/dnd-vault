## Description
---
The most revered void-touched, the void speakers whisper antitruths in [[Void Speech]], drawing power from the tainted unwords. They often began as wizards who stumbled upon some scrap of forbidden lore and studied it so deeply it consumed them. Now they form the leadership and direction of clandestine void cults. Wizards are no strangers to the power of words, and those who accept the gifts of the Void become formidable foes of all sane life. The void speaker can reshape reality with its tainted words, splitting the flesh of foes, driving them mad with fear, or hurling them bodily to the ground.
