## Description
---
_This rat startled the moment it knew it was seen. Within seconds, the one rat became four, and then the four quickly multiplied into sixteen rats._

The result of a [[clone]] spell gone awry, a doppelrat uses short.lived duplicates to overwhelm its adversaries. An easy battle against a single rat can quickly spiral out of control as the doppelrat clones itself into a swarm. and the original rat may hide while combat rages.

**_Stillborn Clones_**. Those who survive a doppelrat's bite suffer from a frightening disease, sloughing off a stillborn clone each day as their own vitality fades. These clones cannot be raised from the dead in any manner.
Doppelrats settle in large city alleys and sewers after they have killed off or driven out normal rats and natural predators. A cat that survives an encounter with a doppelrat avoids any other doppelrats it meets. Doppelrats can sense others of their kind; helpful, since doppelrat litters produce only one truebred creature out of ten. Their parents and siblings devour the others.

**_Clone and Run_**. In combat, they spawn as many clones as they can, and then flee while the copied rats swarm their opponent. By succeeding at a Perception check opposed by the doppelrat's Stealth check, a character can discern the original from all the clones.

**_City Bounties_**. In cities with known doppelrat lairs, magistrates hire spellcasters to scour alleys and sewers and obliterate any rats they find. Shady spellcasters who capture a live doppelrat have blackmailed such magistrates by promising to rescue the town from the rats for an exorbitant fee.

> [!INFO] Running Doppelrats
>The hardest part of this monster is the sheer volume of attacks they generate. To model this, run them in groups of 4 for attack purposes and have those groups all use the same **+5** to attack and do **1d4** damage. That way you need not roll 20 times for all of them, and you reduce the number of rolls required by a factor of 4.
