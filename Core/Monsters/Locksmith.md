## Description
---
>The human-shaped construct is a cobbled collection of mechanical parts. The hundreds of keys hanging about its form jingle as it moves.

**_Call the Locksmith_**. These odd entities are the best in the business at creating secure doors and gates, impassable barriers, and locks of all varieties. They may be inclined to wander from place to place or set up shop in metropolises, offering their services to create or unlock barriers of any kind.

**_Professional Rivalry_**. Each locksmith has a distinct appearance and personality, but they all share the same skill set. A locksmith instantly recognizes the handiwork of locksmith. When a locksmith encounters a barrier constructed by another of its kind, it is compelled to break the barrier or build a superior version. A locksmith hired to undo the work of one of its fellows often volunteers for the task free of charge.

**_Key Features_**. Locksmiths are unique in appearance, but all share a generally humanoid shape. Regardless of other details, they all possess empty keyholes where a human nose would typically be. The key that fits this lock is responsible for imbuing the locksmith with its consciousness. Locksmiths build incredibly complex hidden vaults to hide away these treasured keys.

**_Construct Nature_**. The locksmith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
