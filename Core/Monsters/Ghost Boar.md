## Description
---
_A hulking boar tosses its head and charges, fading in and out of existence as it moves._

**_Magical Creation_**. A magical experiment on a group of albino boars went awry, releasing the enormous beasts into the wild to proliferate.


**_Ghostly Form_**. Ghost boars earn their name from their ability to temporarily become incorporeal. When the ghost boar moves, it becomes ghostly and insubstantial, passing through obstacles as it charges its prey.


**_A Soul Depot_**. A strange side effect of the magical accident that created the ghost boar appears in the strongest of them: they are magnets for souls of the recently departed. The souls can use the meager spiritual magic of the ghost boar to communicate with those nearby.
