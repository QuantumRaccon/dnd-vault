## Description
---
>Screams echo in the night as spears meet wood and flesh. One trollkin pulls its spear from its latest victim while its companion raids the victim's larder.

Trollkin raiders are greedy and efficient, moving together under the command of a trollkin leader to take apart a village, a caravan, or a small fortress. Their goal is generally food and portable wealth. Their training as a unit is not extensive but raiders know, trust, and fight for one another.
**_Night Attacks_**. Trollkin raiders attack in a fast-moving, nocturnal group, often using a group of panicked animals or a fire as a distraction in one place while they attack elsewhere. Their assaults are never daylight attacks over open ground; they much prefer surprise and the confusion of night attacks.

**_Mounted or River Routes_**. While trollkin raiders can lope for miles across taiga or through forests, they far prefer to ride horses or row up a river. It gives them both speed and the ability to carry more plunder.
