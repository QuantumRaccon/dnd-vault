## Description
---
_Visibly charged with electricity, these giant moths range from cerulean to navy blue. Their long, crooked legs dangle from their bodies like bolts of lightning._

**_Free in the Storm_**. The shockwing's presence predicts a great electrical storm when these giant moths breed. They are wild and unpredictable during storms, and many woodland creatures seek shelter from them as much as from the rain.
