Husks are the opposite of [[skeleton \|skeletons]]: undead made entirely from tissue.
**_Waste Not_**. Powerful necromancers create husks from the leftovers of corpses used to animate skeletons. The creation of husks and skeletons at the same time allows a necromancer to create two undead with a single corpse.

**_Undead Nature_**. A husk doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
