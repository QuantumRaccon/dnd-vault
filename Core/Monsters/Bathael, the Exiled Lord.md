## Description
---
>This demon has the lower body of a maggot, merged with a humanoid torso whose flesh appears carved from stone. It wears a helmet that conceals all but its three gleaming eyes. At the point where the two forms meet, it has a wide, slobbering maw with serrated teeth and a roaming tongue.

**_Behind the Scenes_**. Once a dread lord of demons, Bathael was forced to flee from the Abyss after his subjects rose up against him. Since, he has installed himself in the sewers beneath large cities on the Material Plane. He works behind the scenes to make slaves of the people, using them to spread chaos and ruin across the mortal world. After civilization is in ruins, he will return to the Abyss and reclaim his stolen throne.
