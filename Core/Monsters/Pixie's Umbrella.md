## Description
---
>Dozens of flat, purple-capped mushrooms float and spin through the air.

Huge colonies of pixie's umbrellas inhabit the Underworld. When they sense danger, they fill their caps to gain height then release the air, using the flattened caps to slow their descent.

**_Migrating Fungus_**. Their ability to float allows pixie's umbrellas to make homes on hard-to-reach surfaces, frustrating those who enjoy the mushrooms' bitter flesh. The ground beneath wall- and cliff-dwelling pixie's umbrellas is sometimes littered with the skeletal remains of starving travelers who fell in their desperate attempts to gather food.

**_Dizzying Drifters_**. Witnessing the migration of a colony of pixie's umbrellas can be fascinating to those who enjoy watching large numbers of the mushrooms float from cavern to cavern. Intelligent Underworld hunters sometimes use the migration of pixie's umbrellas to mask their approach, counting on the display to distract their prey.
