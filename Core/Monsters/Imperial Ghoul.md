## Description
---
_An imperial ghoul stands tall and proud, its gray flesh robust and muscled, its sharp talons stained black, and its clothing strangely well kept. Its flickering red eyes have an intelligent, malicious gleam._

**_Shock Troops_**. Imperial ghouls are the shock troops of the ghoul empire, and eager to expand its power and influence. Treated like auxiliaries, they get the most difficult tasks: to engage and hold foes while the darakhul, iron legionnaires, and others outflank them.

**_Ambitious Strivers_**. Many believe that the hunger cults or the necrophagi know some secret of transforming imperial ghouls into iron ghouls. This rumor gives them hope of advancement. Their power over the lesser ghouls and slaves gives them a taste of tyranny. Because they are ambitious and always hungry for more power, imperial ghouls are eager to prove themselves as hunters, as warriors, and as spies.

**_Immune to Sun_**. Unlike a standard darakhul, an imperial ghoul does not suffer from sunlight and feels little need to disguise its true appearance.
