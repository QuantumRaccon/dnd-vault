```

## Description
---
>A hideous mass of coiling intestines undulates, ejecting thin, transparent spears of some resinous material from its many orifices. The creature makes a wet slithering sound as it moves unsettlingly through the air.

**_Foulness in Motion_**. The nharyth defies gravity with its every movement, as it pulls itself through the air with its mass of intestine-like appendages. The creature does not seem to possess any natural means of propulsion and can even fly through areas where there is no magic.

**_Creations of Madness_**. Most scholars believe nharyth were created in some insane magical experiment. Others believe they are the spawn of some yet-unknown horror between the stars. Whatever the case, they are clearly not part of the natural ecosystem.
