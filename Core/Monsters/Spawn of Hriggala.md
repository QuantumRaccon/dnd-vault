## Description
---
>The enormous worm bursts from the floor, its maw surrounded by writhing tentacles that grab everything edible nearby. An echo of chanting issues from its mouth, as if a hundred evil priests were trapped within its gullet, calling out maledictions.

The spawn of Hriggala resembles a juvenile purple worm with a mouth surrounded by wriggling tendrils and full of razor-sharp teeth. It serves the demon lord on the Material Plane, powered by a steady diet of flesh and stone.
**_Called by Ritual_**. Servants of the undead god of hunger can call up a spawn of Hriggala through ritual and sacrifices. Controlling the hungering spawn once it arrives is another matter.

**_Underworld Tunnelers_**. The spawn of Hriggala are used to create new tunnels for fiends, darakhul, and other monsters of the underworld.

**_Hungry Demon Nature_**. The spawn of Hriggala requires no air or sleep.
