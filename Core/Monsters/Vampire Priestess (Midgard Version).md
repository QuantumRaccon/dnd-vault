## Description
---
_Pale-faced with long dark hair and a lascivious, predatory look on her face, this vampire priestess wears the crimson robes of the Red Sisters. She wields a scourge covered in vicious barbs, and a human skull stained ochre hangs on a chain from her hip._

**_Followers of the Blood Goddess_**. Temples and shrines exist to the goddess of lust and death in many towns and villages, and the feared Red Sisters ensure that the goddess's will is done. While most of her priestesses are human, their ranks include a number of vampires, who, unsurprisingly, revel in being part of a cult where the blood always flows freely.

**_Undead Nature_**. The vampire priestess doesn't require air.

> [!INFO] Vampires in Midgard
>Vampires rule the Blood Kingdom of Morgau openly, treating the living as cattle to be bought, sold, exploited, and drained of blood by their undead masters. King Lucan reigns supreme in Morgau. His sworn nobles and vampire progeny are the princes, princesses, dukes, and duchesses beneath him, all vampires of great power in their own right. The counts and countesses, who hold smaller territories or powerful monasteries for the King, rank slightly lower than the princes and duchesses. Generals and governors, vampires who command Morgau's troops or rule smaller fiefdoms, sit beneath the counts and countesses.
>Vampire patricians rank lowest among the vampire nobility and make up the majority of the lesser nobles, barons, lords, and ladies of the Blood Kingdomâ€”still quite dangerous, and easily able to command darakhul, vampiric knights, and other servants.
>Vampire priestesses stand somewhat outside of the ranking of vampires in the Blood Kingdom, due to their association with the Blood Goddess' faith. Once a vampire joins the Red Sisters, she is bound to the Blood Goddess, but she is also afforded extra respect and status in Morgau, regardless of her sire or original place in the hierarchy.
>King Lucan and his court are the very first northern shroud-eaters and remain some of the strongest to this day. In the Southlands, shroud-eaters dwell within the Grand Necropolis of Siwal, and many inhabit an island known as the Pallid Court of Vampires within the Nurian city of Per-Bastet.
