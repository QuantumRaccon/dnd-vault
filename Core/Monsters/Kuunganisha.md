## Description
---
_A strange amalgam of imp and quasit hunches beneath batâ€‘like wings. Its feet and hands end in wicked claws, and its eyes and needle-tooth-filled mouth are too large for its bald head._

**_Magical Conduit_**. The kuunganisha were created as mobile, sentient conduits for arcane power. Long-term exposure to a particular school of magic can alter a kuunganisha's appearance, such as fire-feather wings instead of bat-like wings on a kuunganisha regularly used to channel evocation magic or skin covered in non-functioning, but constantly-moving eyes on kuunganishas exposed to excessive divination magic.

**_Flexible Entropy_**. While kuunganisha are always evil, they may be lawful, neutral, or chaotic, depending on the alignment of their masters.
