## Description
---
_Ratfolk are the size of halflings, though smaller in girth and quicker in their movements. At a glance they might even be mistaken for halflings if not for their twitching snouts, bony feet, and long, pink tails._

The ratfolk are canny survivors, rogues and tricksters all. Their strong family ties make it easy for them to found or join criminal societies--though others serve as expert scouts and saboteurs, able to infiltrate army camps, city sewers, and even castle dungeons with equal ease. Ratfolk leaders are often spellcasters and rogues.

**_Adaptable_**. Ratfolk swim well and can survive on little. Some groups are endemic to tropical and subtropical islands. Others inhabit forests, sewers, labyrinths, and ancient, ruined cities.

**_Fast Fighters_**. Ratfolk prefer light weapons and armor, fighting with speed and using numbers to bring a foe down. They have been known to ally themselves with goblins, darakhul, and kobolds on occasion, but more often prefer to serve a "Rat King" who may or may not be a rat of any kind. Such rat rulers might include a wererat, a rat king, an ogre, a minor demon or intelligent undead.
