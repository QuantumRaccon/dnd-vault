## Description
---
_This clockwork spider creature is the size of a dog. Each of its eight sharp, sickle-like feet stabs or sinks slightly into the ground. Razor wire enwraps its body, while gyros whirl visibly in its faceless, clockwork head._

**_Wire Fighters_**. A spider thief never initiates combat unless ordered to, but it always defends itself against attack. Its initial attack is whirling its razor line to entangle a target. Once it snares a foe, the spider thief keeps attacking that target until it stops resisting or it escapes from the spider's wire. By then, it should be ready to ensnare a new victim.

**_Completely Loyal_**. This clockwork machine follows orders from its master even if they lead to its destruction, and it .ghts until destroyed or told to stand down. The machine recognizes only its creator as its master.

**_Guild Tools_**. The spider thief got its name because its ability to climb walls and to effortlessly cross gaps between buildings up to 20 feet wide makes it an excellent accomplice for enterprising thieves. Some thieves guilds make extensive use of them, and many freelance rogues use them as partners.
