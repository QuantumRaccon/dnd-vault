## Description
---
_The kongamato is an evolutionary holdover, a large pterodactyl with avian traits, such as emergent feathers and long, beaklike jaws._

**_Boat Breaker_**. Its name means "breaker of boats," and as that implies, this creature systematically destroys the small vessels of those who come too close to its perch. No one knows what motivates this form of attack, although some sages suppose that the kongamato mistakes canoes for large prey like hippopotami or crocodiles.

**_Spoken in Whispers_**. For some tribes, kongamatos present a terrible threat, and they speak in whispers about them, fearing that mention of the beasts could attract their wrath. In some cases, evil priests and cultists summon these beasts as their servitors and use them to terrify villagers.

**_Maneaters_**. Kongamatos that have eaten human flesh develop a preference for it. These maneaters perform nightly raids on small towns, snatching children and Small humanoids with their claws and flying away.
