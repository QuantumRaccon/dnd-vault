## Description
---
>Thick desert grit encrusts a decayed form as it stalks forward, clouds of biting sand flitting about at its behest.

Apaxrusl, or sand drudges, are created through dark rituals that merge a corpse with desert sand.
**_Soul Infusion_**. The rituals used to create an apaxrusl call for infusing damned souls into the sand, and would-be creators regularly make bargains with demons to acquire this unique component. Oftentimes, the deal goes poorly for the creator, leaving the resulting apaxrusl to wander the desert without a master.

**_Abyssal Intelligence_**. The damned souls filling the apaxrusl give it intelligence, but its constructed form keeps it loyal, making it a valuable asset to its creator. Necromancers often create apaxrusl to lead small groups of undead on specific tasks, confident in the construct's ability to execute orders and lead the undead while away from the direct control of the necromancer.

**_Construct Nature_**. The apaxrusl doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
