## Description
---


Some thri-kreen employ special martial weapons. A gythka is a two-handed polearm with a blade at each end. A chatkcha is a flat, triangular wedge with three serrated blades (a light thrown weapon). A thri-kreen armed with a gythka and chatkchas gains the following action options:

**_Weapons Multiattack_**. The thri-kreen makes two gythka attacks or two chatkcha attacks.
**_Gythka_**.  **3** to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}5 (**1d8 + 1**) slashing damage.
**_Chatkcha_**.  **4** to hit, range 30/120 ft., one target. {@h}5 (**1d6 + 2**) slashing damage.
A few thri-kreen manifest psionic abilities, using their powers to aid the hunt and communicate more easily with outsiders.

A psionic thri-kreen has telepathy out to a range of 60 feet and gains the following additional trait:
