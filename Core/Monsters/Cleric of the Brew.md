## Description
---
 Dwarves love their beer, so it is no surprise that many of them revere the goddess of beer. Clerics of the brew are talented brewers, creating delicious full-flavored mundane ales, but they can also channel the power of the goddess to make special "blessed" brews to aid her followers. They are capable fighters and are often found in the front ranks of dwarven war bands, swinging their maces and inspiring their comrades.

> [!INFO] Clerics of the Brew in Midgard
>The Goddess of Merriment was originally introduced to the dwarves by the wandering Kariv, who still revere her as "Mother Ale." Ninkash, patron of brewers and tavern keepers, is widely beloved among both dwarves and humans and worshipped from the heights of the dwarven cantons to the desert cities of the Southlands. When someone dozes off after a bout of drinking, he or she is said to have "gone to visit Ninkash. " Her clerics, known as the vaer, act as trusted advisers to their communities, and many are empowered with the divine domain of Beer (see Midgard Heroes Handbook).
