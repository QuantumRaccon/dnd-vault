## Description
---
>This skull chatters eerily, gently rocking as it comes to life. It calls out a warning in a hauntingly musical voice.

**_Origins Unknown_**. The origin of these shape-changing monstrosities is unknown, but they have come to be named "wicked skulls" after the form they favor most. Some scholars suggest that they took inspiration from the undead horrors known as [[skull lantern \|skull lanterns]] (Creature Codex). In some cases, there are tales of wicked skulls playing cruel tricks on townsfolk, masquerading as undead just long enough to cause true frightâ€”then chattering before fleeing, harmless, into the night. Undoubtedly, these tricksters revel in disguising themselves as chatty inanimate objects to frustrate more competent adventurers with unsolvable riddles and bad directions.

**_Fun and Games_**. Wicked skulls crave entertainment above all else, and they do not consider their tricks to be malicious. Pretending to be a person transformed into an object or horrifying monster, giving confusing directions through a dungeon, or speaking only in rhymes are just a few tactics they seem to enjoy. A wicked skull avoids direct combat whenever possible and prefers to play mind games.

**_Stealthy Familiars_**. Every so often, a wicked skull grows attached to an adventurer who humors its tricks. In such cases, a wicked skull can become a faithful familiar. Its ability to speak and mimic objects makes these creatures particularly suited for general espionage. However, because wicked skulls delight in games and trickery, they are likely to abandon their chosen companion if they feel their creativity being stifled.

>Some wicked skulls are willing to serve spellcasters, especially those who enjoy a good joke, as a familiar. Such wicked skulls have the following trait.
**_Familiar_**. The wicked skull can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the wicked skull senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the wicked skull is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the wicked skull's Jokester trait. At any time and for any reason, the wicked skull can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
