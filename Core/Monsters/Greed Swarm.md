## Description
---
>The sound of metal clinking against metal becomes a deafening cacophony as a swirling cloud of coins mindlessly hunts for more valuables to absorb into its everexpanding mass.

Located in densely-populated areas, the greed swarm is solely focused on increasing the size of its hovering collection of valuables. Able to differentiate between objects of value and worthless junk, the swarm stalks streets and sewers alike. Its movements are erratic; the cloud swells and contracts in quick succession, repositioning itself in jerky, stilted bursts of motion.
**_Bad Penny_**. The swarm consists of normal, mundane valuables animated by a magical master coin. Often mistaken as a standard regional coin, this master coin is created in a dark ritual to serve as a vessel for pure, ceaseless avarice. If the master coin is destroyed or separated from the swarm, the remaining coins return to their normal inert state and fall to the ground.

**_All that Glitters_**. The master coin cannot exert its power without a large enough supply of valuables to control in close proximity. Bank and vault owners who fail to screen incoming coinage for latent magical properties may find themselves in need of adventurers to discreetly quell a storm of their accumulated wealth. Wishing wells and public fountains are also common homes for greed swarms.

**_Construct Nature_**. The greed swarm doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


> [!INFO] The Three Swarms of Mammon
>In Midgard, clerics of the arch-devil [[mammon, archduke of greed \|Mammon]] (Tome of Beasts) recall the sacred tale of the three greed swarms which appeared when Mammon's avatar arrived atop Demon Mountain by way of an infernally-corrupted shadow road. The swarms descended upon Tintager in the West, Stannasgard in the North, and Runkelstad in the East. After achieving gargantuan sizes, the swarms departed for the Hells, taking with them a vast hoard that resides in Mammon's vaults to this day.
