## Description
---
>A roughly humanoid figure composed of thick, greenish-gray fog steps out of the darkness. Its eyes are smoldering orange orbs, and yellow embers trail behind it as it moves forward, burning the very air with its passage.

**_Spirits of Vengeance and Flame_**. De ogen are the malevolent spirits of murderers and other criminals executed by being burned at the stake or thrown into a blazing fire pit. The depth of their evil and strength of their rage return them to life shortly after death to seek vengeance against those who killed them.

**_Undead Companions_**. A de ogen is usually accompanied by [[shadow \|shadows]] that follow in its wake and drain the strength from those that try to flee its burning wrath. The de ogen ignores the shadows following it and does not cooperate with them in battle. Aside from the shadows that follow it, a de ogen never allies with other creatures, undead or otherwise, and actively attacks any creature it sees unless the creature is composed of flame.

**_Undead Nature_**. The de ogen doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
