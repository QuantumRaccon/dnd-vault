## Description
---
_The creature resembles a great blackened asp with smoldering skin and white-hot serpentine eyes. It slithers as confidently through the air as across the ground._

**_Serpent of Suffering_**. Alnaar demons appear most commonly when a people, race, or species is experiencing suffering. There to hasten the process, the alnaar erupts from the Abyss, leaving massive holes in the firmament of the afflicted cities and towns. The alnaar's only wish is to partake in the suffering of others, and it thrives on tormenting those already beset by tragedy. Disease, calamity, misfortune, and disaster are dinner bells to the alnaar.


**_Devourers_**. These demons have an insatiable appetite, and a single alnaar has been known to devour a cattle herd in minutes. Alnaar who have not eaten recently become weakened and desperate. Some evil warlocks make pacts with alnaar demons, offering piles of meat for service as guardians or assassins.


**_Demonic Mounts_**. When war rages across the Abyss, the great fiery serpents sometimes serve as mounts for powerful demons. A lord of the Abyss streaking through the skies atop the slithering alnaar terrorizes all but the most stalwart foe.
