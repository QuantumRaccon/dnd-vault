## Description
---
The [[Queen of Birds]] is guarded by a special variety of [[terror bird \|terror birds]] with crimson plumage and a golden-green crest rarely seen elsewhere. These terror birds are called red queens, and they are especially savage.

_The flightless terror bird stands nearly ten feet tall atop two immensely powerful legs. Its plumage ranges from dark russet or brown to bright green._

**_Pack Hunters_**. The terror birds live and hunt in packs of ten to twelve individuals. They are clever hunters, drawing their prey into positions that allow the birds to flank. Their attacks are done with blazing speed and ferocity, removing limbs in a flurry of lacerating bites. 

**_Fortress Nests_**. Terror birds live in woods or copses of trees, where they assemble walls made of branches around large nests. The nests have several ways in and out, and creatures without the terror bird's long legs find navigating the nests difficult. Several adults stay behind to guard the eggs and nest while the rest go out hunting.

**_Mounts for Plains Tribes_**. Tribes of dust goblins, hobgoblins, humans, and even gnolls have been known to capture terror birds for use as mounts in battle.
