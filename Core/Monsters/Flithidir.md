## Description
---
>The gnome-like creature flutters from tree to tree, sporting colorful, avian features.

**_Avian Fey_**. Flithidirs are small fey that embody the bright, chaotic nature of birds. They are slender and keen-eyed with feathery crests and feathered wings. Flithidirs are creatures of contrasts—loud and lively, yet prone to moments of calm wonder; bold and cocky, yet easily startled; able to sing with breathtaking beauty or confuse their foes with earsplitting noise.

**_Shapeshifters_**. Flithidirs are shapeshifters, able to change into birds or smaller humanoids, and they favor colorful clothes and adornments, even while shapeshifted. Relentlessly curious, flithidirs often take the form of a bird when they encounter strangers, quietly following and studying the creatures. If the strangers are deemed safe and intriguing, the flithidir approaches in a humanoid form to get better acquainted.

**_Easily Bored_**. Flithidirs tirelessly seek out new things. Some desire new experiences—songs and stories, unusual foods, and sudden discoveries—while others are more covetous, ceaselessly collecting objects they find interesting. Sometimes this greed manifests as a magpie-like desire for shiny things, but a flithidir is also just as likely to be fascinated by items of a certain shape, texture, or color. When a flithidir encounters someone who possesses a thing it wants, it may offer something in exchange—usually a splendid song or acrobatic display—or it may simply request the item with great charm, reacting with frustration or rage if the object is denied to it.
