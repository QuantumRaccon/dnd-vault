## Description
---
_A green-skinned toad croaks as its red boils throb. The warts suddenly glow red-hot, and the amphibian explodes in flames and blood._

Exploding toads are living traps created long ago by ancient dust goblin magic. They look like normal toads but their mouths have razor sharp teeth, and they explode in fire when they die. Most do not recognize the beasts' wicked personalities and explosive potential until it is too late.

**_Goblin Magic_**. Exploding toads are created when a dust goblin ritual is cast upon a group of normal toads. The ritual takes a full day to complete and requires one pound of sulfur per toad being transformed, which is consumed in the casting. The instructions for the spell have never been written down. They are orally handed down from one dust goblin shaman to the next.
There are some spellcasters of other races who have successfully created their own exploding toads, though getting the beasts to cooperate is another matter entirely. Several mages spent years trying to crack the ritual only to have success literally blow up in their faces. The toads only trust dust goblins.


**_Wicked and Suicidal_**. Smarter and more evil than the average amphibian, exploding toads relish their purpose. The savage amphibians die with glee, hoping to immolate as many creatures as possible. Exploding toads arrange themselves in tight groups, knowing that one of their deaths can set off a fiery chain reaction. Dust goblins often place the toads at the bottom of a covered pit or inside a ceiling rigged to collapse.
