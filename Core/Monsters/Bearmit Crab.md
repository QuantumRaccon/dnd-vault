## Description
---
_What at first looks like an innocent pile of rocks on the shore turns out to be the shell of a bear-like creature brandishing two giant crab claws at the end of its powerful arms._

These dangerous monstrosities can turn seemingly harmless beaches and shallows into treacherous stretches of feeding grounds. Only the occasional scattered bones or stuck weapon give any clue as to the true nature of these creatures.

**_Coastal Guardians_**. Created by a great wizard to guard her coastal keep in years long past, these monstrosities now roam the rocky coastlines, indiscriminately preying on unfortunate victims near the shore and in shallow waters. Sometimes, those particularly adept at taming and training wild beasts may keep small groups of bearmit crabs as guardians.


**_Crafted Homes_**. Driven by the scarcity of shells large enough to accommodate their size, bearmit crabs have adapted by crafting their own shells, using rocks glued together with sticky propolis. More commonly known as bee glue, propolis is harvested by bearmit crabs from the hives they find near the coastline.


**_Viscid Shells_**. Many adventurers get a nasty surprise when they try to stab or slash at the shell. Intuitively, the attackers aim for the crevices between the rocks, only to find their weapons hopelessly stuck fast in the shell's binding agent. To further complicate matters, bashing on the shell with blunter weapons doesn't prove particularly effective. Often, weapons of past victims are compelling lures, for few can resist a seemingly unattended sword sticking out of a pile of rocks.
