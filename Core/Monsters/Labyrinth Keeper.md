## Description
---
_The minotaur moon priestess stands at the center of the maze, raising her silver axe to the skies as the lunar light glistens off her silver horns. Behind her, the labyrinth keeper's hands and eyes begin to glow._

**_The Maze Keepers_**. The minotaur labyrinth keepers create and restore the maze-lair of their clan. The keeper takes careful notes, studies those who breach its creations, and, when necessary, defends the maze with its clan-mates.
