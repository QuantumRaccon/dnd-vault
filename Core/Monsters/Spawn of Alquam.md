## Description
---
>This large creature exudes darkness and contempt. It has feathery wings, backswept horns set behind its wide eyes, a narrow, vicious-looking beak, and talon-like claws. Its body is thin and sinewy, and its skin is a sickly green.

**_Demonic Servants_**. These demons lurk in darkness, serving and protecting [[Alquam, Demon Lord of Night \|Alquam, the Demon Lord of Night]] (Creature Codex). Alquam is known to send them to aid his cults, and he sometimes utilizes them to assassinate individuals who threaten his followers. Because the spawn are created by Alquam, many of his cults worship them as physical representations of the Demon Lord himself. The cults believe that offerings to the spawn are conveyed directly to their master in his planar abode.

**_Kinship with Shadow_**. When the spawn of Alquam venture to the Material Plane, they take care to move only in places that are cloaked in darkness. While direct light does not harm them, they find it uncomfortable and often flee from it.

**_Lords of Birds_**. Birds instinctively follow the mental commands of the spawn of Alquam, and sudden changes in bird behavior that can signal a spawn is nearby. Swarms of birds attack targets the spawn designates, act as the spawn's messengers, and enact the spawn's or Alquam's will in whatever way either demon dictates.
