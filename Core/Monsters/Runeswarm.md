## Description
---
>A cloud of inky runes churns as some of the markings illuminate briefly.

**_Untended Runes_**. Runes that have gone unused for years or those created on ley lines sometimes gain a modicum of sentience and coalesce into a gestalt known as a runeswarm. The mix of runes flits about in random directions and remains inert except when it encounters living beings.

**_Early Warning_**. Runeswarms trigger their rune randomly, but the runes creating an effect light up moments before the swarms invoke the runes, giving canny observers the chance to prepare for the runeswarms' effects.


> [!INFO] Runeswarms and Rune Magic
>When a runeswarm is destroyed, it dissolves save for one random rune. A creature can learn how to inscribe a rune of power for that type of rune, as if it possessed the Rune Knowledge feat. If the creature already has the Rune Knowledge feat for the rune, it treats that rune as if it possessed the Rune Mastery feat. If it already has the Rune Mastery feat for the rune, it instead reduces the time required to inscribe the rune by 50 percent (minimum 1 action). For more information on learning and using magical runes, see the rune magic chapter in _Deep Magic for 5th Edition_.
