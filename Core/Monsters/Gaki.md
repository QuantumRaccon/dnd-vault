## Description
---
_A wretched spirit, at once both emaciated and bloated, stuffs huge handfuls of filth from a dung heap into its gaping, toothy maw._

The gaki, or hungry ghosts, are restless spirits of avaricious humans, cursed by the gods to live eternally in constant hunger. This hunger manifests itself as an insatiable desire to consume filth or cannibalistically devour human carrion. A hungry ghost appears as a hairless human with deep, bruised-blue skin stretched tight over both its emaciated ribs and its pendulous belly.

**_Desperate Hunger_**. Gaki rarely hunt mortal creatures. Though gaki can kill mortal creatures and devour their flesh, they find the rancid taste of carrion far more appetizing. When gaki do attack humanoids, it is because that mortal is keeping it from eating. Gaki cursed to eternally feed on feces, for instance, stalk outhouses and viciously attack the creatures relieving themselves within, as the gaki believes the creatures are guarding their rightful meal.


**_Esoteric Devourers_**. A hungry ghost is cursed to consume a single thing for eternity. Usually the object of their hunger is disgusting refuse like feces or garbage, but some gaki have more unusual tastes. Often, these tastes ironically reflect the sins these spirits committed in life. Gaki are generally benign, but the hungers that put them in conflict with civilized creatures—such as hungering for gold, clothing, magical scrolls—are the most destructive of all.


**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The hungry ghost doesn't require air or sleep.
