## Description
---
>Several humanoid silhouettes reach out with dark claws. The light shifts, revealing that they are connected to each other by a great mass of flowing darkness.

While common [[shadow \|shadows]] are fearsome undead in their own right, the overshadow is a terrible darkness that threatens all life it encounters, especially life that clings to light in the deep, dark places of the world.
**_Spawned by Tragedy_**. A creation of great misery and of hope dying in the dark, an overshadow forms when travelers become lost underground. As their supplies dwindle and their lives slowly extinguish in the cold bowels of the earth, an overshadow rises from the bodies. The collective psychic trauma of mass deaths in the dark seeds a portion of the darkness with undead energies, a collective intelligence, and a sinister intent.

**_Fueled by Fear_**. While the desire to consume life force is just as strong in the overshadow as its weaker brethren, its greater intellect also gives greater depth to its evil. It enjoys playing with its prey, scaring potential victims with displays of its power, with whispered threats from the darkness, and with other psychological tactics. It prefers to drive its victims into a state of panic before finally devouring their essences.

**_Doom of the Shadowless_**. The shadows of those killed by the overshadow fuse with it instead of becoming separate [[shadow \|shadows]]. If a creature killed by an overshadow is brought back to life by any means other than the [[resurrection]] spell or similar magic, it does not cast a shadow until the overshadow that slew it is destroyed. When such a creature is returned to life, the overshadow is aware of the creature's return. In addition, undead shadows are drawn to attack the shadowless creature.

**_Undead Nature_**. An overshadow doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
