## Description
---
_With enormous eyes, a wide mouth, and almost no chin, the deep ones are hideous, fishlike folk, often hunched and scaled when encountered in coastal villages._

**_Elder Gods_**. In their fully grown form, the deep ones are an ocean-dwelling race that worships elder gods such as Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, and they dwell in deep water darkness. They've intermarried with coastal humans to create human-deep one hybrids.

**_Coastal Raiders_**. The deep ones keep to themselves in isolated coastal villages and settlements in the ocean for long periods, and then turn suddenly, at the command of their patron gods, into strong, relentless raiders, seizing territory, slaves, and wealth all along the coasts. Some deep ones have even founded small kingdoms lasting generations in backwater reaches or distant chilled seas.

**_Demand Sacrifices_**. They demand tolls from mariners frequently; those who do not leave tribute to them at certain islands or along certain straits find the fish escape their nets, or the storms shatter their hulls and drown their sailors. Over time, some seafaring nations have found it more profitable to ally themselves with the deep ones; this is the first step in their patient plans to dominate and rule.

> [!INFO] Gods of the Deep Ones
>The deep ones are faithful servants of horrific powers inimical to all life on land. Father Dagon is a god of fertility, fish, and the strength of the deep ocean, and is an evil lord of storm and waves. Mother Hydra is his consort, a goddess of immense strength and size, spawning entire schools of fish at once and mistress of the great kraken and toothsome krake spawn, who are her children and servitors. Both are keen on conquest, through a long program of forced interbreeding and eldritch meddling with human bloodlines.
>In addition, many deep ones follow Shar-Ngolyeth, a long-lost deity also referred to as That Which Lurks Beneath the Waves. This kraken and her krake spawn offspring are close allies to the deep ones, but are largely indifferent to Dagon and Hydra.
