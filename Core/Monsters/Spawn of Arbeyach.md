## Description
---
_This insectile humanoid's mouth stretches over dripping mandibles that are poorly concealed behind an ill-fitting mask of flesh. Its eyes have compound irises, and barbed stingers sprout between the fingers at the ends of its long, segmented limbs._

**_Skin and Carapace_**. Spawn of Arbeyach are roughly humanoid, with many insectoid qualities including a hardened carapace and oddly-jointed limbs. Their faces, arms, and legs are covered with a largely decorative skin which stretches and tears to reveal insectile traits beneath.

**_Carrion Eaters_**. Spawn of Arbeyach are scavengers and predators that feast on both living creatures and carrion they find within their territory.

**_Hive Dwellers_**. They dwell in hive structures comprised of natural growth and rigid architecture. The hives are built in isolated, easily-defensible locales (hilltops, forest canopies, and even cliff dwellings). Visitors often must climb or fly to reach themâ€”some such hives built by the tosculi, who share them with the spawn of Arbeyach.
Most spawn of Arbeyach stand between 4 and 6 feet tall, and they weigh between 85 and 160 lb.
