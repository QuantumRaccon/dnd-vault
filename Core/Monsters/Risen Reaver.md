## Description
---
_A body that might once have been human now has four legs and nightmarishly long, thick arms. What's worse, its skin has been flayed off, revealing the dead muscle and sinew beneath._

**_Spirt of War_**. The risen reaver is an undead born from a warrior fallen on the battlefield. Its body becomes an avatar of combat, with four legs and a pair of long, heavy arms. In the process, it sheds its skin, becoming entirely undead muscle, bone, and sinew.

**_Absorb Weapons_**. When risen reavers take form, they absorb all weapons around them. Some of these weapons pierce their bodies, and others become part of the risen reaver's armament. Their four legs are tipped with blades on which they walk like metallic spiders. Their arms are covered in weaponry infused into their flesh, which they use to crush and flay any living creatures they encounter.

**_Battle Mad_**. Risen reavers are battle.maddened spirits of vengeance and slaughter, obsessed with the chaos of combat that led to their own death. They hunt the living with the sole purpose of killing, and they thrive on violence and murder. As they died, so should others die.
