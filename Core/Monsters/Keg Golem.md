## Description
---
_An ornate keg with a stern dwarven face, arms, and legs walks about the tavern, dispensing drink to any and all._

Dwarven runes adorn the metal of the keg golem, powering it. Some dwarves use the golems to promote their favorite drinking spots.

**_Creation_**. Keg golems are created when dwarven rune masters acquire a keg of their strongest ale and carve magical runes into it. The creator then forges a replica of its own face onto the front of the keg. The process requires two weeks of forging and runic inscription. The runes glow with the arcane energy of the creator, ranging from faint blues to dark reds.


**_Mobile Guardian_**. Many dwarves create these constructs to use as a mobile source of ale on long journeys. When its master is threatened, the golem helps to incapacitate the adversary with its powerful ale blast. If lost, stolen, or bartered for, a keg golem can be used for promotional purposes or for guarding a tavern.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
