## Description
---
_Wisps of humid wind revolve around this spiny ball. Two massive black eyes and a dark mouth are the only features visible through its static straight quills._

**_Chaos Aging_**. Despite its comical appearance, a slow storm is a creature of chaos, able to visit the pains of old age on the young and fit. It turns the bodies of physically able creatures against them, forcing them to choose between relative inactivity or ever.increasing pain.

**_Surrounded by Wind_**. A slow storm is a smaller creature than the space it occupies, and its vulnerable physical body is protected by a cyclonic wind surrounding it. The slow storm occupies a space 15 feet square, but its physical body occupies just the center 5-foot space. The nucleus of a slow storm is a two-foot radius sphere weighing 75 lb. The rest of the space is "occupied" by protective, high-speed wind. Only the central, physical body is susceptible to damage; the wind is just wind. Enemies using melee weapons with less than 10-foot reach must step into the whirlwind to attack the slow storm.

**_Static Generator_**. A slow storm has no internal organs other than its brain, and it lives on the energy and moisture it drains from opponents. Its quills not only deflect debris but also generate a ball of static electricity that delivers a shock attack.
