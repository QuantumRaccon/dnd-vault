## Description
---
_A brawny looking kobold brandishes a manticore spike driven through its scaled hand._

**_Leaders_**. The barbed are physically stronger than their brethren and bear the scars of living close to manticores. They are devoted to Mantik and believe he is a divine being who will lead them to victory over the drakes of the waste and the dragons of the mountains.

**_Marked_**. The barbed are known by the large tail spike (from Mantik himself) driven through their wrist and hand. They are immune to the poison that still seeps from the spike.
