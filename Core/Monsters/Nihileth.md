## Description
---
_Eons ago, a group of aboleth left the Material Plane to wander through distant planes—seeing them through magical scrying was not enough, so these aboleth used astral magic and bodily travel to see far beyond normal realms._

**_A Forgotten Tribe_**. As ages passed, memories of those who departed slowly faded from the minds of those aboleth who remained behind. Those few aboleth who did remember that long ago some of their kin had gone plane-wandering assumed that the wanderers must have died in distant hells or paradises.

**_Changed by Planar Wandering_**. The plane-wanderers hadn't died. Instead, their eons-long exposure to alien realms and to the space between changed them, restructuring their life force and making them into something even more nightmarish—but better able to withstand both strange hells and golden realms of eldritch delight.

**_Servants of the Void_**. They returned even more corrupt and powerful than they had left, and these wandering nihileths returned to the mortal world intent on spreading the influence of the Void and the utter evil they found in the vast darkness between worlds.

> [!INFO] What is Void Speech?
>Void Speech is the language of creatures of the Outer Darkness in the Midgard Campaign Setting, spoken by vile things that are malevolent towards humans and their allies, and that seek to bring about ruinous apocalypse of dark gods. Substitute any ancient language with an evil reputation if you are using another setting.


**_A Nihileth's Lair_**. While aboleths create their lairs underwater, spending most of their time submerged, a nihileth lair can be encountered out of the water, often in a cave or ruined, abandoned city.
