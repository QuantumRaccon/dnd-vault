## Description
---
_A nightmare wrapped in chains and built of cutting cogs and whirring gears, an automata devil howls like a hurricane in battle. Once chain devils, automata devils have been promoted to greater power._

**_Guards and Overseers_**. Sometimes called castigas, automata devils are made to monitor others. They are often put in charge of prisoners or infernal factories.

**_Pierced by Chain and Wire_**. This slender creature's skin is pierced with barbs, sharp nails, and coils of wire, which have been threaded through its flesh. Chains are buried under blisters and scabs. This infernal horror's eyelids—both front and back pairs—have been sewn back with wire, while six arms ending in large grasping hands erupt from its shoulders.

**_Coiled Metal Whips_**. The creature's back is broad and massive. Its head is a black mass ending in two large mandibles.
By its side, it carries a huge coiled whip that squirms like a snake and is said to scent lies and treachery. The creature's stomach opens up like a second mouth, filled with spines.

>One corner of the Eleven Hells is known simply as the Forge. Here, black chimneys rise a mile high from a dead land of choking air and red poison hills. The Machine, a greater devil who never sleeps and never lets his subjects know rest, rules this land. His overseers consist of thousands upon thousands of imps who whip and punish the workers. The imps themselves are kept in check by hordes of chain devils, who in turn answer to the automata devils as overseers.
