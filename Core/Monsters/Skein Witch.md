## Description
---
_Skein witches are androgynous humanoids mummified in writhing diamond thread. Their skin is translucent, and suspended inside their bodies are dozens of quivering hourglasses in place of organs_

**_Shepherd Destiny_**. Skein witches are curators of destiny and enforcers of what must be. They voyage across the planes, weaving the strands of fate at the behest of their goddess-creator. Although they carry out their charge without regard to petty mortal concerns, they can be persuaded to bend fate for powerful petitioners whose interests align with those of their goddess.

**_Surrounded by Guardians_**. Despite their supernatural abilities, a skein witch's physical body is frail. Because of that, they tend to surround themselves with undead, constructs, or other brutish, soulless guardians cut free from the thread of fate.

**_Fear All Cards_**. If a [[deck of many things]] is brought within 30 feet of a skein witch, she emits a psychic wail and disintegrates.
