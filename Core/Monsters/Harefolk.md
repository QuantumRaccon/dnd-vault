## Description
---
>What appears to be an arctic hare given humanoid form is clad in leather armor and stands with its shortsword at the ready. Its bright eyes take everything in, while its nose quivers in search of predators.

**_Werewolf Foes_**. Harefolk have a long-standing hatred for [[werewolf \|werewolves]], owing to their near extinction at the lycanthropes' jaws. All present-day harefolk know the story of Mathilda Lopear who, along with an adventuring band of humans (often downplayed or removed from stories about Mathilda), fought and killed a werewolf tribe and saved the lives of the last remaining harefolk clans. Because of this ancient enmity toward werewolves, harefolk are wary of other lycanthropes and shapechangers, even primarily good-aligned creatures such as [[werebear \|werebears]].

**_Rabbit Tenders_**. Harefolk keep [[hare \|arctic hares]] and other rabbits capable of surviving in arctic climes as pets. They believe the presence of rabbits brings good luck to a clan. Nomadic clans of harefolk ensure their pets can forage grasses as they travel, while more domestic clans grow gardens of hardy vegetables to feed the rabbits. Since harefolk are omnivorous, supplementing their diet of grubs and other insects with vegetation they find or grow, their dietary needs keep them from competing with their pets for resources. Though they are capable of eating flesh from other creatures, their bond with rabbits keeps many harefolk from hunting game animals, including non-rabbits. Adventuring harefolk often bring along a rabbit as a companion animal or familiar.

**_Pranksters_**. Harefolk enjoy pulling harmless tricks on each other, and stories of memorable pranks are passed down through generations. When dealing with their enemies, harefolk pranks turn injurious if not lethal. One of their favorite tricks is to seed areas beneath the snow with [[hunting trap \|snares]] and [[bear trap \|bear traps]]. As they lead pursuers through these areas, they bound safely over the snow while the creatures pursuing them sink below the surface and set off the traps.
