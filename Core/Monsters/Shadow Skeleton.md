## Description
---
_The skeleton's ribs are filled with shadow essence, which slithers in constant motion like the writhing of eels in a carcass. The whole sight is disquieting as it moves itself with a gliding, almost liquid step._

**_Shadow Realms and Rivers_**. Shadow skeletons are often servants to shadow river lords (see page 327) or other powerful creatures of shadow. Their writhing purple hearts generate a small amount of lightâ€”just enough to cast a shadow, never more.

**_Malign Intent_**. Unlike ordinary skeletons, shadow skeletons have been known to display some cunning and a certain depth of cruelty. They sometimes chase small living animals or fling bits of bone and shadow at birds or bats.

**_Undead Nature_**. The shadow skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
