## Description
---
>An amalgam of various bird species crows proudly as it hops forward.

**_Chimeric Avian_**. The body of an august rooster is nearly human-sized with the head of a pheasant, the body of a perching duck, the tail of a peacock, the legs of a heron, the beak of a parrot, and the wings of a swallow. There is wide variation among specimens of this hybrid, however, with different creators replacing portions of the creature depending on the material they have on hand during the creation process. Most august roosters are created entirely of avian material, though specimens evidencing snake necks, turtle shells, and stag bodies have been encountered. Once created, an august rooster can reproduce with any species of bird, which usually results in an exotic-looking example of the bird. Only three percent of eggs fertilized or laid by an august rooster hatch into another august rooster. An august rooster fused by magic is full grown at creation, while one that hatches naturally grows to adulthood over the span of six to eight months.

**_Selfish and Self-serving_**. August roosters display the basest instincts of their creators, and they have the mental faculties and temperament of a spoiled, malicious child. Their sole concern is their own comfort, and they use their natural gifts to force nearby humanoids to tend to their wants and needs. Young august roosters are brazen about their collections of servants, often working the servants to exhaustion with constant demands. More mature individuals have a strong sense of self-preservation and have their servants see to their needs only when they know it will not raise suspicion.
