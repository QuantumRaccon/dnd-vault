## Description
---
_A gnarljak looks like a bear trap springs sprung to clacking life and ready to tear flesh apart._

**_Hopping Motion_**. All steel and springs, a gnarljak is easily mistaken for a simple bear trap when lying dormant. But once it starts hopping in pursuit of a target, it reveals its animated nature and its only motivation: destruction of living things.

**_Endless Snapping_**. Gnarljaks are mindless. They do not grow tired. They exist only to pull creatures to the ground and chew through them, then turn around and chew through them again.

**_Defensive Traps_**. Some try to use gnarljaks to guard treasures or booby-trap approaches to important locations, but their indiscriminate biting makes quite dangerous to their owners as well. Certain monsters such as redcaps and shadow fey use gnarljak's with some regularity, and gnomes are very fond of making them part of a standard tunnel defense.
