## Description
---
>This hairless, dog-like creature has pale skin, an enormous bladder underneath its throat, and a conical head with two deep-set, black eyes. A long, thick red tongue, ending in a hollow spike, flicks from its shrew-like mouth.

**_Ravenous Blood Eaters_**. The bloodsapper is a vampiric creature with an unrelenting thirst for blood. While it can drink the blood of animals and wild beasts, it vastly prefers the blood of sapient bipedal creatures, such as giants and humanoids. When it catches prey, it uses its long, spiked tongue to impale and drain them until they are little more than husks. Due to its appetite, the bloodsapper frequently comes into conflict with other creatures reliant on blood such as [[stirge \|stirges]], [[vampire \|vampires]], and [[chupacabra \|chupacabras]] (Creature Codex), though it usually retreats if outmatched or outnumbered by its opponents.

**_Strange Dogs_**. Because of their dog-like bodies and propensity to form into packs when hunting large numbers of prey, bloodsappers are frequently confused with evil canids like worgs and hell hounds, despite their clearly aberrant nature. Some believe bloodsappers were artificially created by an aboleth scientist, vampire mage, or similar entity, or that the creatures originated from beyond the stars or another realm of existence entirely.
