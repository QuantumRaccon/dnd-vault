## Description
---
_This humanoid wears robes to hide its corpselike pallor and lifeless gray hair. Fine, arm-length worms wriggle through abscesses in its flesh and its empty eye-sockets. It moves stooped over, with a shuffling gait, belying its speed and agility._

Wormhearted suffragans are devoted followers of Qorgeth, demon lord of worms, who they believe is the servant and forerunner of a dark goddess of worms and decay.

**_Dark Worm Hearts_**. Formerly, the suffragans were priests or holy officers of other faiths, but their hearts were corrupted by their fear and loathing. Once pledged to the service of the devouring worm, Qorgeth replaced their hearts with a bulbous, writhing conglomeration of worms, which permits them to carry on with an undead mockery of life.

**_Prey on the Wounded_**. They frequent graveyards, casting [[Detect Evil and Good]] or [[speak with dead]] to learn who was truly cruel and duplicitous in life. They also follow armies, visiting battlefields shortly after the fighting is over. In the guise of nurses or chirurgeons, they select their targets from among the dead and dying for as long as they remain undetected. In both cases, they cast [[animate dead]] to provide the worm goddess with viable skeletal or zombie servants.

**_Fear Light and Radiance_**. Wormhearted suffragans have a weakness; they are especially susceptible to the flesh-searing power of radiant magic, and for this reason avoid priests of the sun god or gods of light. At night, however, they are a walking contagion, infesting their enemies with parasitic worms that devour victims from within. Their favorite tactic is to cast hold person, attack with a helminth infestation, then animate their slain enemies into unlife.


**_Demon Lords_**. Demonic powers swarm throughout the lower planes without number. Ancient beasts fade from mortal history, only to reappear eons later when their schemes draw them back to the Material Plane.
