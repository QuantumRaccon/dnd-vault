## Description
---
_A large black bull rips up the earth in great heaps. White wings spread wide from his shoulders, and a burning sun disc floats between his white horns._

Gugalanna, "The Great Bull of Heaven Who Makes the Earth Shake," is an instrument of Heaven, sent to trample enemies into dust. The sun disc between his horns makes clear his authority.

**_Wrath of the Divine_**. Gugalanna often arrives in times of war, torture, slavery, or oppression in answer to prayers by the poor or the plague-ridden. While rare, these forms of divine intercession occur often enough that evil-doers are familiar with some of its ways and portents. Shining clouds are said to foretell Gugalanna's arrival, as are flowers blooming in midwinter or on the altars of dark gods.


**_A Friend to Brother Ox_**. The animal lord [[Brother Ox]] seems to be a friend to Gugalanna; the two sometimes work together.


**_Hatred of Blood Magic_**. The biggest source of evil that brings Gugalanna's attention is the use of blood magic. The use of this form of magic invariably involves blood sacrifices, ritual murder, and other horrors. Gugalanna shakes down the pillars of temples devoted to such activities.
