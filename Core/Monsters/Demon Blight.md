## Description
---
A demon blight can blame its existence on druids with evil intent. Usually, these horrendous fiends are summoned during a ritual which combines a hatred for forests, blood sacrifices and the power from the roots of a Gulthias Tree. These creatures are then put to work protecting the Gulthias Tree's supplicant army as it spreads its evil across the land.

**_Twisted Limbs_**. Demon Blights move in an almost bi-pedal fashion, its long branchlike arms pushing and pulling it. When hunched over, the demon blight is approximately six feet in height, but when standing tall it is more like nine. Its appearance is a mass of animated branches, twigs and vines with pseudo-wings and long twisting horns on its forehead.
**_Silent Killers_**. A demon blight can't speak, but makes a clacking sound, which speeds up as it coils for an attack. This sound can be heard with a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check, but its source can't be determined, especially if the blight is motionless in the undergrowth.
