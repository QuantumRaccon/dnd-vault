## Description
---
>The skeleton of a humanoid stands bent over with one arm holding the vacuous space where its stomach would be. Its jaw hangs agape, cackling, as it points at the target of its humor.

**_Ironic Origins_**. When a creature who utterly fears death perishes in an area filled with necrotic energy, it arises as a cackling skeleton. The creature's dead bones animate to mock the futility of their once-cherished desire of life. The cackling skeleton often wears garish items that parody what it loved in life.

**_Nihilistic Hecklers_**. Cackling skeletons find living creatures' survival instincts humorous. They find living incredibly futile and believe those that prolong their existence to be hilariously foolish. Unlike other skeletons, cackling skeletons are capable of speech, and they use it to point out the silliness of healing, wearing armor, or other means of self preservation, often pointing out the creature will inevitably die anyway.

**_Undead Nature_**. The cackling skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
