## Description
---
_This vaguely humanoid-shaped plant boasts shimmering black and plum-colored leaves sprouting from from its head, back, and arms. The leaves are wickedly sharp and can be shaken loose to form deadly slashing clouds._

**_Roots in Shadow_**. Razorleaves grow where the veil between the Shadow Realm and the Material Plane has thinned and darkness bleeds through into the soil. Their plant-like bodies are tinged with shadow magic but are as tangible as any other shrub or tree. Their roots are made of pure shadow and have a corrupting effect on other plants and animals around them.

**_Letting the Light Out_**. Mature razorleaves have a darkening effect on the area in which they live. Nonmagical sources of light are only half as effective in these plants' groves. There is a 50% chance that a portal to the Shadow Realm will appear wherever three or more razorleaves dwell. Sustained by the presence of the plants, the portal serves as a doorway between worlds.
