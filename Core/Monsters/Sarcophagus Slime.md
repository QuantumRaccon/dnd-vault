## Description
---
_The sarcophagus opens to reveal an eerie, scintillating light. Wisps of gelid amber ectoplasm undulate outward from a quivering mass with a blackened skull at its center._

**_Vigilant Slime_**. Sarcophagus slimes are amorphous undead guardians placed in the tombs of the powerful to guard them and to wreak terrible vengeance on would-be defilers of the ancient crypts. They seethe with baleful energy, and their blackened skulls retain a simple watchfulness.

**_Muddled Origins_**. Many sages speculate that the first sarcophagus slime was spawned accidentally, in a mummy creation ritual that gave life to the congealed contents of canopic jars rather than the intended, mummified body. Others maintain sarcophagus slime was created by a powerful necromancer-pharaoh bent on formulating the perfect alchemical sentry to guard his crypt.

**_Death to Tomb Robbers_**. These ectoplasmic slimes are the bane of burglars and a constant danger for excavators and antiquarians exploring ruins or tombs. The rituals for their creation have not been entirely lost; modern necromancers still create these undead abominations for their own fell purposes, and tomb robbers are turned into slimes if they lack proper caution.
