## Description
---
_Mylings are the souls of the unburied, those who died in the forest from abandonment or exposure and can find no peace until their bodies are properly interred. Given the circumstances around their deaths, mylings tend to be solitary. They haunt the places where they died. When some tragedy resulted in multiple deaths, the resulting mylings stay together and hunt as a pack._

**_Attack in a Rage_**. Mylings prefer to attack lone wanderers, but they target a group when desperate or when there's more than one myling in the pack. They shadow a target until after dark, then jump onto the target's back and demand to be carried to their chosen burial ground. They cling tightly to a victim with arms and legs locked around the victim's shoulders and midsection, begging, threatening, and biting until the victim gives in to their demands. Mylings will bite victims to death if they are unable or unwilling to carry them, or if a victim moves too slowly.

**_Ungrateful Rest_**. While all mylings seek a creature to carry them to their final resting place, even when a chosen "mount" is willing to carry the myling, the creature's body grows immensely heavier as it nears its burial place. Once there, it sinks into the earth, taking its bearers with it. Being buried alive is their reward for helping the myling.

**_Urchin Rhymes and Songs_**. Some mylings maintain traces of the personalities they had while alive—charming, sullen, or sadistic—and they can speak touchingly and piteously. Dressed in ragged clothing, their skin blue with cold, they sometimes reach victims who believe they are helping an injured child or young adult. They hide their faces and sing innocent rhymes when they aren't screeching in fury, for they know that their dead eyes and cold blue skin cause fright and alarm.
