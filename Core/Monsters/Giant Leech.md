## Description
---
Giant leeches lurk in placid ponds, babbling creeks, and mighty rivers. They slink through the dark forest waters with their distinctive vertical undulation, following any movement they sense toward fresh blood. Some varieties have adapted to life in the oceans, and a rare few dwell on land, though land-dwelling leeches prefer humid, moist climates.
