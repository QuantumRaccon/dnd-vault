## Description
---
_This lovely lass is clad in diaphanous veils and a revealing skirt, and she shows graceful skill while dancing through the dust._

**_Humanoid Sand_**. In its natural form, a mirager resembles a shifting mass of sand and dust with a vaguely humanoid shape, crumbling away like a sandcastle in the wind.

**_Enticing Illusion_**. A mirage can take on the guise of a lovely man or woman with luminous eyes, delicate features, and seductive garments. Whether male or female, a mirager dresses in veils and flowing robes that accentuate its enticing beauty.

**_Thirst for Blood_**. Whatever its apparent form, a mirager's existence is one of unnatural and endless thirst. They hunger for flesh and thirst for blood, and they draw especial pleasure from leeching a creature's fluids in the throes of passion. A victim is drained into a lifeless husk before the mirager feasts on the dehydrated remains.
