## Description
---
>A wingless reptile with a long, lithe body and short, powerful legs scurries down an alley after a rat. Its pointed snout darts into the hole where its prey disappeared.

The keyhole dragonette is a small, wingless dragon with flexible bands of large, overlapping scales, a pointed snout, and a wide, flat tail.
**_Urban Exterminators_**. Keyhole dragonettes were magically bred to be adept at entering closed-off or hard-to-reach places. Their original purpose was to seek out and destroy nests of rats and other city-dwelling vermin, but they regularly find themselves employed as living lockpicks. Their sensitivity to vibrations helps them find prey no matter where it is hidden, and their long, deft tongues enable them to pick even the most complex of locks. Dragonettes have difficulty delineating between pests and pets, and they sometimes consume the furry companions of the people whose homes they are ridding of vermin.

**_Big Eaters_**. Belying their small frames, keyhole dragonettes have voracious appetites and can consume a variety of foods. Aside from meat, they enjoy fruits, nuts, and vegetables. Keyhole dragonettes with easy access to sugary foods often develop a sweet tooth.

**_Loyal Companions_**. Guards, wilderness scouts, and rogues of all types often see the value in taking a keyhole dragonette as a companion. Young dragonettes are easy to train and eagerly bond with people, quickly becoming steadfast friends with their caretakers. If the person a dragonette has bonded to dies or leaves, the dragonette becomes despondent. The depression can last for years if something doesn't occur to lift the creature's spirits.


> [!INFO] Keyhole Dragonette Familiars
>Some keyhole dragonettes are willing to serve spellcasters as a familiar. Such dragonettes have the following trait.
**_Familiar_**. The dragonette can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the dragonette senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the dragonette is within 10 feet of its companion, magic, including the dragonette's breath, can't put the companion to sleep. At any time and for any reason, the dragonette can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
