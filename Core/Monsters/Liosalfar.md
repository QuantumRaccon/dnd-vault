## Description
---
_The curtain of rippling colors assumes a humanoid form. Its kaleidoscope body shifts and glitters with mesmeric patterns._

Sometimes known as "light elves" because they assume a vaguely elfish shape, these enigmatic shapeshifters make their home at the edge of the world, where reality bends and physical laws unravel. Their mutable bodies are composed entirely of shifting colors. Among themselves they communicate through flashing patterns and hues, but they talk to other races in an echoing, choral tone that seems to emanate from everywhere and nowhere around them.

**_Servants of Fate_**. Their aims often seem inconsequential or simply baffling, but they've also sundered mountains and toppled kingdoms. Many believe they're agents of Fate, others that their motivation is an alien aesthetic or their own amusement.

**_Pattern Vision_**. Those who've spoken with liosalfar say they talk as if all existence was a sea of patterns and colors to be set in pleasing shapes. They barely understand mortal concerns.

**_Enemies of the Ramag_**. The liosalfar have a longstanding rivalry with the portal-making ramag, whom they despise as "corruptors of the patterns."

> [!INFO] Liosalfar in Midgard
>Once the patrons of the elven kingdom of Thorn, the liosalfar are dwellers in the northern lights that hover over Hyperborea. The liosalfar are aloof protectors of that lost realm, but they spend most of their time traveling between Midgard and other planes of existence. They have a gift for patterns, and they are explorers and meddlers by nature.
