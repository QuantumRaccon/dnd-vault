## Description
---
_With paws big enough to walk on top of fresh snow and senses sharp enough to hear or scent prey on windswept hills or steppes, the snow cats are superb hunters and fiercely independent._

These panther-sized cats have the features of a lynx, including the long fur at the tips of the ears, and they can hear a snowshoe hare hopping a hundred yards away.

**_Camouflage and Patience_**. A snow cat's coat changes with the seasons and ranges from stark white to muddy brown. They are patient hunters, preferring to ambush prey from high places. Their typical prey includes everything from mice and rabbits to goats, sheep, and small pigs.

**_Friends to Small Folk_**. Gnomes and halflings have an affinity with these predatory animals, and it is common for several snow cats to serve as guards and scouts for a halfling village or a gnomish settlement. Stories of snow cats serving as mounts for small folk seem to have some truth to them, though this is rather uncommon.

**_Feeding Frenzy_**. Some snow cats enjoy working as a hunting pair or as a scout for a mountain druid or steppe ranger. However, they are extremely difficult to pull away from a kill. Once they have their teeth in something, they get very possessive and cannot be convinced to part with a carcass unless given some other food in exchange. In hills or forests, they often hide a recent kill up a tree or on a high ledge and return to it over several days to devour it all
