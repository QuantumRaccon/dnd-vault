## Description
---
>This tall, lanky humanoid is sightless, its eyes nothing more than useless spots in its otherwise human face. The creature is encased in a sheath of thick orange jelly, almost as if it had been dipped in a giant pot of honey. The jelly wobbles and slides over the creature's body as if alive.

**_Sightless Alchemists_**. The mydnari are an eyeless, evil subterranean race that lives alongside oozes. They delight in capturing other creatures and using the creatures for experimentation or as food for their colonies of oozes and slimes. They constantly experiment with new serums, tonics, and concoctions, striving to always improve themselves and their connection with their oozes.

**_Bound in Jelly_**. Each mydnari enters into a symbiotic relationship with a mutated strain of [[ochre jelly]] as soon as it is born. This is a sacred rite among the mydnari, and without this link a mydnari is cast out and soon succumbs to the elements. The mydnari provides long-term sustenance for the jelly, and the jelly provides the sightless mydnari with protection and the ability to better sense its environment.

**_Oozing Cities_**. The cities of the mydnari are dominated by flowing spires and twisting walkways, and they are always bathed in a sickly yellow-green radiance. Oozes and slimes are found almost everywhere, whether simply wandering along the street to clean up refuse or serving as living baths for mydnari nobles. Their cities also boast a large section dedicated to alchemy, and the sulfurous and sometimes noxious odors from the many alchemical labs float through the city for all to smell.

**_Detested Necessity_**. The mydnari are viewed with revulsion by duergar and other subterranean races who rely on their alchemy. Only derro and [[aboleth \|aboleths]] are known to tolerate the mydnari for any length of time.

**_Oozebound Nature_**. A mydnari doesn't require sleep.
