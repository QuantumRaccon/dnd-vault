## Description
---
>This massive shark-eel surges out of the water, opening titanic jaws large enough to bite a ship in half.

**_Bribable_**. Wise captains traveling through timingila hunting grounds often carry tithes and offerings in hopes of placating the creatures.

**_Lesser Leviathan_**. The timingila is one of the largest creatures in the seas. Some scholarly tomes suggest a connection between the timingila and rarer [[leviathan \|leviathans]] but no definitive proof has yet been found.

**_Master of the Seas_**. The timingila is an apex predator of the oceans. It hunts whales primarily but eats anything it can catch. The timingila is fiercely territorial and considers all of the ocean its personal domain.
