## Description
---
{@i A barely visible humanoid silhouette stalks the desolate and ruined place, killing any who would seek its secrets.

**_Warped by Arcane Catastrophe_**. The wrathful byproducts of cataclysms caused by arcane warfare, wind eaters were once humanoids. Now twisted into near-invisible, roughly human-shaped creatures, they wander their shattered homelands, attacking any intelligent life that comes near.

**_Wasteland Wardens_**. Though they take a spiteful pleasure in hurting creatures whose lives remind them of what they once were, wind eaters retain a kernel of decency, which motivates them to thwart any exploration of their homes. They seek to stop the deadly knowledge that destroyed their bodies and their homes from falling into other hands that might inflict the same misery elsewhere.

**_Undead Nature_**. The wind eater doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep
