## Description
---
>A semi-permeable bubble surrounds a blue-tinged gas. The bubble jauntily bobs in the air.

**_Consumers of Exhaled Gases_**. Swampgas bubbles feed on concentrated exhalations from living creatures. They surround their victims' heads and extract these gases, usually in copious quantities as their victims panic and breathe harder. This leads many to believe the bubbles are sadistic. However, encounters with swampgas bubbles are rarely fatal, since the bubbles typically sate themselves by the time their prey falls [[unconscious]], losing interest as the creature's breathing slows.

**_Attracted to Fire_**. A swampgas bubble is instinctively drawn to fire, even though they are highly flammable. Its susceptibility to fire makes it relatively easy to dispatch, but its explosive ending makes the use of fire risky for its foes. In fact, this form of death, accompanied by a beautiful burst of blue light, is just part of the bubble's overall lifecycle. Its outer layer hardens and shatters, and the remaining bits fall into the swamp where they grow and encase swamp gasses, developing into new swampgas bubbles.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A swampgas bubble doesn't require sleep.
