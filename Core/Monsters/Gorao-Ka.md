## Description
---
>The wizened, doll-sized woman sits beside a small shrine of bonsai branches. She smiles and reaches into a full pouch, removing a gold coin. She passes the coin with an encouraging nod to the desperate-looking man kneeling before her.

**_Small Gods of Substance_**. Gorao-ka represent small fortunes of both a physical and spiritual nature. Their shrines can be erected anywhere, but they are commonly found in settlements and widely-traveled areas. Larger settlements have multiple shrines, sometimes one or more per neighborhood, each of which is associated with a different gorao-ka.

**_Gentle and Benevolent_**. Gorao-ka have a kind look for every person that crosses their path. Each of them has a burning desire to assist people, and they grieve on the occasions that they can't. The laws governing their kind forbid them from extending aid to someone that hasn't made an offering at their shrine, though a gorao-ka accepts almost anything in tribute.

**_Thieves' Bane_**. Despite their generous natures, gorao-ka have no pity for those who steal from them. Fools who steal from gorao-ka swiftly discover their money inexplicably vanished, and can end up destitute if they don't make reparations.

**_Immortal Spirit Nature_**. The kami doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.


> [!INFO] Kami in Midgard
>Kami are the small gods of the Winter Isles. Each kami is the spirit of something tangible, be it an ideal, an emotion, or a specific item or location. A kami can be summoned to the Material Plane by any creature that builds it a shrine and offers suitable tribute. Less majestic kami, such as a gorao-ka, require only a small shrine and a gift of any size, so long as it is freely given. More important kami may require a magnificent monument as well as some form of grand tribute.
