## Description
---
Azers are elemental warriors crafted from bronze native to the Elemental Plane of Fire. Whilst most azers are content with a life in the forges of their kingdoms, others turn to worship and oaths to fill their time.

These azers often worship the elements themselves, ancient primordials, or gods of the forge and fire. Azers who prove their devotion to their gods are imbued with divine magic, allowing them to cast spells and smite with wrathful force.
