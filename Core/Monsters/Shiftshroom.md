## Description
---
>The plain, white mushroom suddenly shifts and twists into a poisonous deathcap.

In their natural form, shiftshrooms are white mushrooms with bifurcated stalks. Their natural ability to disguise themselves as other mushrooms evolved as a defense against creatures harvesting them for food.
**_Sought for Food_**. Roasted shiftshroom has a nutty flavor and aroma and is considered a delicacy by many of the Underworld's denizens. Discerning surface world gourmands pay respectable sums for shiftshroom caps due to the difficulty in harvesting them from the Underworld and the difficulty in growing them above ground.

**_Hidden in View_**. Shiftshrooms can often be found interspersed with deadlier fungi. The Underworld hides colonies of the fungus wherein only a few of the mushrooms toward the outer edges of the group are dangerous varieties of fungus, and the remainder are disguised shiftshrooms.
