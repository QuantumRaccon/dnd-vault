## Description
---
_A savage parody of a djinni, an al-Aeshma's lower half is composed of scorching winds and desert sand._

**_Sand Djinnis_**. The al-Aeshma are former djinn and share the same powers, albeit in a darker style. Their skin is black as pitch, and their whirlwind form includes much dust and sand. Only radiant or fire damage can slay them entirelyâ€”otherwise the desert sand flows to seal their wounds and reattach severed limbs.

**_Obligation of Wishes_**. Granting three wishes to a mortal is a sacred and serious obligation among the genies, referred to as being wishbound. The Lords of Air mandate this as celestial law, and many believe that a djinni cannot refuse to grant a wish. Certainly the consequences of disobedience are dire.
Those djinn who decline to grant a wish, for any reason, are stripped of their wish power and handed to efreeti for 1,001 years of torture and debasement. Those that survive are banished to wander the Material Plane.

**_Unforgiven_**. No al-Aeshma has ever been forgiven. Their punishment drives them mad, and makes them anything but contrite. Al-Aeshma are a feral, mocking scourge to all other genies, even efreeti, for they know many secrets and their hearts lust for revenge.
