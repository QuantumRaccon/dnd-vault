## Description
---
_Hide armor and scraps of mail are nailed onto this scarred and tattooed mole-like beast. A ring of tentacles sprouts above its mouth, which is dominated by spade-like incisors. The beast has no visible ears and only tiny, cataract-filled eyes. Blood and foam fleck from its tentacled maw._

**_Grown from Chaos_**. What the derro have done with certain breeds of dogmole almost defies description, but the secret of their size is a steady diet of chaos fodder, magical foodstuffs and spells that force the creatures to grow and grow.

**_Scarred and Abused_**. Brutalized from birth and hardened by scarification, foul drugs, and warping magic, the dogmole juggernaut is barely recognizable as a relative of its smaller kin. A furless mass of muscle, scar tissue, and barbed piercings clad in haphazard barding, a dogmole juggernaut stands seven feet tall at the shoulder and stretches nine to twelve feet long. Its incisors are the length of shortswords.

**_Living Siege Engines_**. Derro use dogmole juggernauts as mounts and improvised siege engines, smashing through bulwarks and breaking up dwarven battle lines. When not at war, derro enjoy pitting rabid juggernauts against one another in frenzied gladiatorial contests.
