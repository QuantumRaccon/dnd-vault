## Description
---
_This small, leering water spirit resembles a cross between a gray frog and a damp scarecrow, with small tendrils sprouting from all its extremities. It has water wings seemingly made out of jellyfish flesh, allowing it to jet through the water at high speeds._

**_Swamp Robbers_**. Known as "uriska" in Draconic, the bolotis are small, swamp-dwelling water spirits which delight in drowning unsuspecting victims in shallow pools and springs, then robbing their corpses of whatever shiny objects they find. Bolotis use their magical vortex to immobilize their victims and drag them to a watery death. They delight in storing up larders of victims under winter ice or under logs.

**_Fond of Allies_**. Bolotis sometimes team up with vodyanoi, miremals, and will-o'-wisps to create cunning ambushes. They are happy with a single kill at a time.
