## Description
---
>The mouth of this massive flytrap hangs limply, and the smell of decay emanates strongly from it.

**_Disease Eater_**. Viirets feed on diseased flesh and plant matter. The swamplands they inhabit are rife with maladies, giving them plenty of opportunity to find food. Viirets have an acute sense for diseased matter, regardless of the disease's source. While they aren't bothered by eating untainted prey, such prey isn't as nutritionally satisfying. Their stomachs quickly burn through healthy prey, leaving the viiret hungry shortly afterward.

**_Unpleasant Odor_**. The viiret has developed a form of mimicry where its sickly odor deters healthy creatures from approaching it. The viiret is even repellent to most insects.

**_Desperate Cure_**. Marshland societies aware of the viirets' ability to remove disease often view the plants as agents of harsh deities that demand a price for divine gifts. These societies send plague victims on dangerous pilgrimages to find the plants. The plants devour these pilgrims and remove diseased flesh. This process is dangerous, as many who enter the plant hopeful of eliminating the disease die as a result of the injuries they suffer. To mitigate this, multiple ill people travel together to viirets, optimistic the plants will expel newly healthy specimens in favor of a sickly one.
