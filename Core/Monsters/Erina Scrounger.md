## Description
---
_This small humanoid has a slightly pointed face with bright, brown eyes and a black, snout-like nose. Its skin is covered in short, tan fur, and its head, shoulders, and back have smoothed-down quills._

Erinas, or hedgehog folk, are a small, communal race.

As the largest and hardiest of their kind, erina defenders take the defense of their home tunnels very seriously, and are quite suspicious of outsiders. Once an outsider proves himself a friend, they warm considerably, but until then defenders are quite spiky.

**_Burrowed Villages_**. Natural diggers at heart, erinas live in shallow networks of tunnels and chambers they excavate themselves. Enemies who attack the peaceful erinas easily become confused and lost in the mazelike tunnels. On their own ground, the erinas can easily evade, outmaneuver, or surround invaders. They often lure them onto choke points where the enemy can be delayed endlessly while noncombatants and valuables are hustled to safety through other tunnels.

**_Scroungers and Gatherers_**. Erinas are naturally curious. They tend to explore an area by tunneling beneath it and popping up at interesting points. They dislike farming, but subsist mainly on the bounty of the land surrounding their homes. In cities, they still subsist on what they can find, and they have a knack for finding whatever they need. Sometimes they are called thieves, but they aren't greedy or malicious. They take only what they need, and seldom take anything from the poor. Some humans even consider it lucky to have a family of erinas nearby.
