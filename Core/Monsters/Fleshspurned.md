## Description
---
>This horrifying apparition is the disturbing amalgam of a funerary shroud and a set of absurdly large floating teeth. The creature has a roughly humanoid form and clacks its teeth together with terrible ferocity.

**_Ghosts with Teeth_**. A fleshspurned is created when a humanoid is eaten alive or dies while swallowed by a creature such as a purple worm. These people are driven insane by their horrible deaths and arise as monstrous spirits that crave the flesh of other creatures to replace the bodies they lost. However, in a twist of fate, the fleshspurned cannot stomach corporeal flesh, leading it to consume the ectoplasm of wraiths and ghosts or the essence of creatures it turns ghostly with its strange bite.

**_Ghosts Hunting Ghosts_**. Fleshspurned are treated with a mixture of fear and loathing by intelligent ghostly creatures, such as specters and ghosts, since any ghostly creature killed and devoured by a fleshspurned is permanently destroyed, even if it would ordinarily return to haunt an area after being killed. Fleshspurned are sometimes controlled by powerful necromancers to act as ghost exterminators, clearing out haunted graveyards and ruins of other spiritual undead.

**_Undead Nature_**. The fleshspurned doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
