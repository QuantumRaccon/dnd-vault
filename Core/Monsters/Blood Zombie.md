## Description
---
_The bloody corpse shambles onward, its footsteps easy to follow. It is feared and ruthlessly hunted by the forces of light._

A blood zombie has been infused with necromantic magic that gives it a semblance of life. A coating of flowing blood covers the zombie, making it appear as though a shower of crimson constantly pours down its body.

**_Vampire Toys_**. Vampires find blood zombies highly entertaining and faintly obsceneâ€”but cannot seem to resist touching, licking, or even draining the creatures of some quantity of blood.

**_Servants of Blood Cults_**. Not surprisingly, blood zombies are often created to serve blood mages (see page 397), priests of blood cults, or dark temples. In these cases, the blood zombies are often marked with an unholy symbol or compelled to participate in dark sacrifices.

**_Undead Nature_**. The blood zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
