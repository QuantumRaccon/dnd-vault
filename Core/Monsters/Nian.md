_The creature has the body of a massive, powerful bull and the head of a sleek and majestic lion with a single curved horn rising from its skull._

**_Divine Punishment_**. It is said that nian are sent by the gods to punish villages that have fallen out of favor or committed some terrible crime. Others believe that nian simply come to take food and riches that are not theirs, hoarding their treasures in underwater grottos or mountainous caverns.

**_Sign of Beginnings and Endings_**. nian regularly hibernates for months, preferring to hunt during times when the seasons are shifting. Because of this, many villages in the east use a nian's appearance as a signal of changing times. The celebrations that take place during times of change in these villages, such as harvest festivals or new year gatherings, include many of the objects that ward against nians: red decorations, fiery displays, and clanging instruments.
