## Description
---
_The earth shudders with every footfall of a Jotun giant, the immortal enemies of the gods. Tall enough to look a titan in the eye and strong enough to wrestle a linnorm, Jotun gaints are the lords of giantkind. Their enormous halls are carved in mountains and glaciers throughout the Northlands._

**_Foes of the Gods_**. As foes of the northern gods, they plot to regain their former status as lords of Creation. Many know ancient secrets and snippets of antediluvian arcane lore, and so may have abilities beyond those listed below. More powerful Jotun giants straddle the line between mortal and demigod.

**_Contests and Challenges_**. Like many giants, the Jotun enjoy a challenge, even from tiny little humans. Only the mightiest heroes can challenge a Jotun giant's might in physical combat. Using cunning or trickery is a safer betâ€”though being too cunning is also angers them, and Jotun giants are no fools.

**_Seekers of Ragnarok_**. The Jotun giants know great magic, and strive to bring about end times of Ragnarok.
