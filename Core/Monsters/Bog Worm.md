## Description
---
The colossal monster that is the bog worm torments swampland creatures as it swims through deep marshes in pursuit of prey. An oafish creature with a voracious appetite, this creature thinks of everything it comes into contact with as a prospective meal.

**_Apex Predator_**. Even the smallest noises attract the bog worms, which have been known to lie hidden in wait and strike quickly when prey is near. Civilizations which live close to swamps maintain special vigil around their settlements to deter these monsters. Though most common in large swamps, bog worms are sometimes seen on the surface world in wetlands and waterlogged areas. The jaws of a bog worm are large enough to swallow a grown man whole and no creature is safe from its appetite. It can quickly thrust itself forward by alternately contracting and expanding its body, catching other bog dwellers by surprise with the speed of its advance.
**_Bounty of the Bog Worm_**. When a bog worm burrows through the quagmire, it gobbles up dirt and stones and even boulders, which it breaks down and constantly excretes. Just like their purple cousins, valuable metals and precious stones can also be found within the bodies of bog worms and they are sought out and hunted for this treasure by reckless adventurers. A burrowing bog worm keeps creating new passages throughout the wetlands, which become useful for other creatures to navigate subterranean caves. Consequently, regions with abundant prey quickly become interlaced with a complex maze of passages under the wetlands when a few bog worms come together to hunt.
