## Description
---
>A giant raptor roars out its fury in spouts of fire and scalding water while lightning crackles through its feathers.

**_Territorial_**. Anzu are fierce and territorial predators, claiming ranges along the edges of deserts, wide grasslands, or high mountains. Extremely long-lived, they mate for life, producing two or three eggs every decade.

**_Elemental Birthright_**. Offspring of a wind god or primordial wind spirit, anzu are the personification of the south wind, lightning, and the driving monsoon. Uniquely tied to the elements of fire, water, and wind, they react poorly to weatheraltering magic.


> [!INFO] Anzu in Midgard
>In the Midgard campaign setting, anzu are the children of the windlord Khamsin the South, and many anzu guard the escarpment along the eastern side of the Chelamite Mountains. Others can be found on the Rothenian Plains and in the grasslands of the far East.
