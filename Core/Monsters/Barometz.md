## Description
---
>This creature resembles a large horned goat covered in thick green moss. A vine trails from the beast's udder to a nearby tree. The creature smells of fresh bread and floral grapes.

**_Born of Fruit_**. The barometz is a strange plant-like monster that arises spontaneously from a normal fruit tree, some say as the result of ancient druidic magic or fey meddling. A fruit tree bearing a barometz grows an unusually large fruit that soon drops from the tree and bursts open to reveal the goat-like creature. The barometz remains attached to its parent plant by a vine and spends its life clearing the area around the fruit tree of weeds and other noxious plants.

**_A Feast for Kings_**. The flesh of a barometz is considered a delicacy by almost all humanoids and giants, and few barometz survive for long once they are discovered by a band of trollkin hunters or foraging hill giants. Elves and other woodland humanoids have attempted to breed barometz, without success. The creature does not reproduce naturally and the methods by which they appear are still unknown.
