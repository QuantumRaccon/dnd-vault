## Description
---
Trained as part guardian and part assassin, the cultists of Selket are organized into cells strike in the name of the Scorpion Goddess. The scorpion cultist watches for those who blaspheme the name of their goddess or defile its sacred places. Their enemies find themselves the target of poisoned blades or an apparent accident, while those who praise Selket or care for the desert nomads are quietly helped. On special missions, their cell leader, scorpion cultists might doff their traditional garb and infiltrate towns or cities.
