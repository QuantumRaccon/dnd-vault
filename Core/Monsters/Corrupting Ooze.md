## Description
---
_A corrupting ooze boils and bubbles with rank marsh gas and the fetid stench of the sewer, and it leaves a stinking trail of acidic slime wherever it goes._

**_Swim and Walk_**. A corrupting ooze is a festering slime that can slither and even swim like a gigantic sea slug, or it can assume a roughly humanoid form and shamble through the streets, though its stench and its lack of speech make it unlikely that anyone might mistake it for a normal person. They are frequently soldiers and servants to heralds of blood and darkness.

**_Dissolve Bones_**. A corrupting ooze can absorb an entire large animal or small person, simply dissolving everything including the bones in a matter of minutes. This function makes them an important element of certain dark rituals.
