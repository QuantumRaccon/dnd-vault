## Description
---
_A suit of elven parade armor, beautifully ornate but perhaps not terribly functional, stands at attention._

**_Beautiful Construct_**. Like the monolith champion, a monolith footman is an esthetic triumph in the construct.builder's craft. If anything, form takes a higher priority in the footman than function, since their function is largely to look fine as they stand ready to perform servant's duties for their shadow fey masters.

**_More Servant than Warrior_**. Because it's fashioned as grand armor, the footman looks more ferocious than it is. Its fighting ability is nothing to dismiss, but fighting is not its primary function. It's a combination of household servant and watchdog with imposing martial flair. Like the champion, a monolith footman's most alarming power is its ability to replace an opponent with a shadow double. This threat should be taken seriously by strangers to shadow as they weigh the risks of causing trouble in the fey courts.

**_Perfect Loyalty_**. Monolith footmen follow orders to the letter and are unswerving in their loyalty.
