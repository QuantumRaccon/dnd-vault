## Description
---
_Pale-skinned, beautiful humanoids without gender, these angels are wrapped in black, swirling mist in the shape of elegant robes._

**_Three Forms_**. The sammael angels are often referred to as the "Gods' Severity," owing to the grim tasks assigned them. They are the angels burdened with execution, destruction, and punishment. Their weapons and tactics vary depending on the nature of their assignments. Executioners appear as muscled warriors, wielding massive, radiant axes. Destructors arrive with flaming fists and wield both elemental and divine magic. Punishers arrive with cruel whips, whose lashes sear both body and soul.
**_Strong-Willed_**. Despite the dark nature of their work, sammael angels show no malice on their luminescent visages. Though their assigned tasks often run counter to their alignment and divine nature, the angels maintain their inherent goodness. This strength of will makes them unshakable in combat.
**_Immortal Nature_**. The sammael angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
