## Description
---


A gray ooze that lives a long time can evolve to become more intelligent and develop limited psionic ability. Such occurrences are more common in gray oozes that live near psioncic creatures such as [[mind flayer]], suggesting that the ooze can sense and mimic psionic ability.

A psionic gray ooze has an intelligence score of 6 (-2), as well as the following additional action.

**_Psychic Crush (Recharge 5-6)_**. The ooze targets one creature that it can sense within 60 feet of it. The target must make a DC 10 Intelligence saving throw, taking 10 (**3d6**) psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
