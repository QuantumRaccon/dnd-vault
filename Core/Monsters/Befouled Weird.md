## Description
---
>Water filled with algae, worms, and other detritus rises up in a serpentine form. It reeks of stagnation and rot.

**_Corrupted Water Elementals_**. When aquatic parasites invade a [[water elemental]], they take control of it and seek to propagate. The host becomes a befouled weird, providing protection and an ideal environment for the parasites. It prefers warm, marshy environments where the parasites are more at home. While the weird can carry any parasite, it most commonly acts as a host for brain-eating amoebas.

**_Exiles to the Material Plane_**. Water elementals prevent befouled weirds from infesting the Plane of Water. Otherwise, the tainted creatures infuse pure water elementals with their parasites. Water elementals knowledgeable about such things equate a plague of befouled weirds to ghouls infecting and turning humanoids into ghouls.

**_Elemental Nature_**. The befouled weird doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
