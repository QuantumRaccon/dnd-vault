## Description
---
>Rising up from the seafloor is a nightmarish creature resembling an obese mermaid with a wide, fluked tail, claws, and a humanoid head with a fish-like mouth and large, saucer-like, yellow eyes. An organ like the anchor of a boat emerges from its brow, shedding a pale blue light that glimmers off its iridescent crimson scales.

**_Monster Creator_**. Yavalnois are wicked aberrations capable of procreating with almost any creature from the sea, be it a [[sahuagin]], [[giant crab]], or even a [[kraken]]. The results of these unions vary. Most often the offspring is identical to the other parent, but sometimes it is another yavalnoi or something completely different, leading to many of the more aberrant creatures of the deep oceans.

**_Objects of Worship_**. Many intelligent evil sea creatures such as sahuagin and [[lesser scrag \|lesser scrags]] (Creature Codex) venerate yavalnois almost as if they were gods, guarding them and keeping them happy and fed. A yavalnoi is usually accompanied by several fawning sahuagin, scrags, or similar monsters willing to lay down their lives for it.
