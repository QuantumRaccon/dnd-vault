## Description
---
_Around a corner in the wine cellar stumbles a surly, two-foot tall man carrying an open bottle of wine. He has a bushy beard and wears a rumpled, red overcoat over a dirty white shirt and kneelength red trousers with blue stockings and silver-buckled shoes. A cap made from leaves stitched together with gold thread slouches atop his head, and he reeks of stale beer and wine._

**_Drunks in the Cellar_**. Clurichauns are mean-spirited, alcohol-loving fey that plague butteries and wine cellars. These drunken fey were once leprechauns, but they long ago forsook a life of toil for one of solitary debauchery. Now they spend every night drinking, warbling off-key, and tormenting their hapless hosts with cruel pranks.
However, if the clurichaun's host keeps him or her well supplied with a favorite libation and otherwise leaves him or her alone, the clurichaun will protect their wine cellars from thieves, drunkards, or worseâ€”becoming quite vigorous when they feel the security of the cellars is threatened in any way. They have a particular hatred for rum gremlins and for other clurichauns.

**_Contest Evictions_**. Most people can't tolerate or afford a clurichaun's presence for long. Unfortunately, attempts to drive them off usually result in the spiteful clurichaun going on a destructive rampage and them spoiling any remaining wine. The best way to evict a clurichaun is to challenge him or her to a drinking contest. A clurichaun can't abide losing to a mortal and will slink away in shame, never to be seen again, if that happens. This is a risky option, however, because despite their size, clurichauns can drink prodigiously with little ill effect.

**_Small Brawlers_**. While clurichauns aren't adverse to an old-fashioned tavern brawl, they rely mainly on their magic to protect themselves. Creatures under a clurichaun's spell feel and act as if they were intoxicated, complete with hangovers the next morning!
