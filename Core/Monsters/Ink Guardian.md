## Description
---
_A spill of ink slowly grows in size, corroding intruders without harming the nearby texts._

Often left by wizards in libraries or studies, these small bottles produce an ink that can endanger any intruder that might come near. They protect their creators' residences while posing little risk to the books and manuscripts around them.

**_Expansive Presence_**. An ink guardian first appears as a very small blob of ink, but, as it confronts intruders, it grows in size until it is large and imposing.

**_Projected Protector_**. The bottles from which these guardians come are often mundane in appearance and seamlessly fit into the environments where they are found.

**_Dangerous to Intruders_**. An ink guardian's ink is corrosive only to flesh, not wood or paper. It is not uncommon for wizards to return to their studies to find no sign of invasion other than the odd staff or pile of clothes lying on the floor.

**_Ooze Nature_**. An ink guardian doesn't require sleep.
