## Description
---
_A humanoid made of clods of earth, worn stones, and fragments of metal roams a forgotten battlefield. When it spies a potion, faint light flares in its eye sockets and the creature rushes toward it._

Sometimes mistaken for solitary earth elementals, cauldronborn arise from potions, corrupted by time or magic, that infuse nearby materials. The material animates with the potion's fluid holding the body together. They appear around ancient battlefields or magical ruins, searching for more potions to absorb and fuel their growth. Since a cauldronborn is only interested in potions, scavengers can search the same areas for other magic items the cauldronborn ignores. Having a lead-lined chest to safely store the magical items is vital to avoid the creature's attention.

**_Corruption Given Form_**. Nearly all cauldronborn arise from the common [[potion of healing]], thus their forms regenerate slowly. It is possible for other potions to grant cauldronborn corresponding benefits.


**_Fueled Growth_**. Absorbing more potions increases a cauldronborn's resilience and eventually leads to gaining additional permanent benefits. The additional magical fluid also allows it to add more pieces onto its form and grow in size. It continues this cycle of searching, absorbing, and growing as long as it exists..


**_Magically Obsessed_**. Cauldronborn are innately aware of magic and fixate on absorbing potions. They become increasingly frantic and dangerous when they sense potions nearby. A farmer may only need to engage in a brisk walk to stay safely out of reach of a creature on the hunt, while an alchemist carrying several potions will be run to ground by the desperate construct.


**_Construct Nature_**. A cauldronborn doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
