## Description
---
Arrow Demons are four-armed human shaped fiends that fight with two large longbows. Abyssal strength allows it to wield its longbows with deadly accuracy. This emaciated creature's gray skin is moist, oily, and entirely hairless. Its four toed feet grip the ground as it walks.

**_Scouts and Spies_**. These cruel demons serve as warriors in the endless Blood War. They are common soldiers in the armies of demon lords against all who would challenge the lords of the abyss. In large battalions they rain down arrows upon their enemies. In smaller cohorts they make effective assassins.
