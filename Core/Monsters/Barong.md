## Description
---
_The king of spirits and leader of a host of celestials, Barong manifests as a large lion with thick, white fur. He wears a red mask and his body is adorned with gilded armor, polished to a mirror finish._

**_Sworn Enemies_**. Barong has sworn his life to the defeat of his former lover, Rangda, the demon queen of witches. Though he works to spread harmony throughout existence, much of his time is spent countering Rangda's schemes.

**_Celestial Allies_**. Barong is rarely without an entourage of like-minded celestials ready to aid him at a moment's notice. Good-aligned ghosts and wraiths flock to him, particularly those wronged by loved ones or who fell victim to Rangda and the machinations of her worshippers.
