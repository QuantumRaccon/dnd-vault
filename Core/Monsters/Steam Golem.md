## Description
---
_With wicked axe blades fastened along its arms and bronze runes inlaid on its armored torso, a steam golem is a smooth-running machine of death._

**_Boilers and Hydraulics_**. A steam golem is built around a central boiler with clockwork gears and hydraulic cylinders powering its legs and arms. Most steam golems have axe blades welded onto each of their arms, and many can extend one arm into a single, long-hafted axe for additional reach. They tower 10 feet tall, and their legs are often built with reversed knee joints for greater leverage when they move. The eyes of a steam golem glow orange or red from its internal fires.

**_Steam Whistle_**. A steam golem has four to six vents for releasing steam. These whistles are mounted over the shoulders and can be heard at distances up to a mile in open terrain.

**_Fuel Required_**. A steam golem's machinery consumes 30 lb. of coal and 100 gallons of water per day if it engages in more than brief combat. When resting or standing guard, a steam golem needs just one third of those amounts.
