## Description
---
_This plant stands taller than an ogre, and it shuffles forward on a thick mass of tangled roots. A wicked-looking stinger, glistening with venom, flicks out of its "mouth" on the end of a whip-like tongue._

**_Born for War_**. Warlock's trumpetblooms were created by a mage and his cabal through a series of bizarre experiments that involved cross-breeding native jungle orchids and giant carnivorous plants with alien seed pods. The mage supervised the experiments personally, frequently consulting a living brain he kept in a glass cylinder. When the first trumpetblooms were propagated from seedlings, the mages were astounded at how quickly the plants grew and subsequently reproduced. An unstoppable army was within their graspâ€”or so they believed. The mages' optimism proved misguided when the trumpetblooms broke free of the glasshouses and attacked their masters.

**_Aggressive Carnivores_**. Warlock's trumpetblooms are aggressive and intelligent plant creatures that seek to spread their seed pods throughout the jungle and beyond. Trumpetblooms are carnivores, feeding on the small deer, giant insects, and snakes that live in the jungle. They happily devour humanoid flesh when available, using their roots to soak up the nutrients from a decomposing corpse.
