## Description
---
_These mounted knight wields great swords as swift as dawn, as bright as the blazing sun, and as cold as the grave. The white horseman is a young rider full of promise, the red rider a man in his prime, and the black rider a scarred and bearded fellow, his eyes dark and his mouth set in a grim frown. They ride with purpose on powerful steeds._

Baba Yaga's three horsemen are legends in their own right. Bright Day, Red Sun, and Black Night (also known as the White, Red, and Black horsemen) are her faithful emissaries, scouts, and warriors abroad. The three horsemen change over time, but they are typically male, human warriors. Their appearance is distinctive: each dresses in colors and lacquered armor and trappings to suit their name, with their magical horses colored to match. Their roles appear to coincide with their appointed offices, although their precise relationship to Baba Yaga is the source of much speculation.

**_Varied Origin_**. They may be serving Grandmother Winter for a time in exchange for a favor or bargain, or they may be cursed to replace a previous horseman they slew. In either case, Baba Yaga is the source of their power. The horsemen are innately connected to the domain of time; each represents part of the day, as measured by the sun. Bright Day is bound to and governs dawn to mid-day, Red Sun from mid-day to sundown, and Black Night rules until daybreak. While Baba Yaga herself is wily and capricious, her three horsemen are bound to cosmological forces that are uniform and constant, which is reflected in their alignment and demeanor.

**_One Rises, Two Set_**. The horsemen never co-exist with one another except within the confines of their mistresses' Dancing Hut and the fenced yard around it. Each one must yield his presence on the Material Plane to his successor in rotation (this varies on other planes, depending on intervals of day and night). Forcing two horsemen to co-exist on the Material Plane places a perilous strain on reality. Bringing all three together could trigger a primal magical event or chronal catastrophe.

**_Timeless Nature_**. The horsemen don't age and don't require food, drink, or sleep.


> [!INFO] Baba Yaga's Horsemen in Midgard
>The great witch Baba Yaga is a power to be reckoned with in Midgard, always plotting with her daughters, the vila, and seeking to gobble up the vile gnomes whose souls she claims are rightfully hers. Baba Yaga rules over great ley line magic, and commands the elements and enchantments with ease, but she cannot be everywhere at once.

>Three of her most faithful servants are the White Horseman, the Red Horseman and the Black Horsemanâ€”embodied forms of the times of day, and a symbol of Baba Yaga's mastery of time itself. She uses nicknames for them, calling them "My Bright Dawn, my Red Sun, and my Dark Midnight" because they are bound by time (and some believe, because they control dawn, noon, and sunset). She has many other servants as well, but the horsemen, her dancing hut, and the sorcerer Koshchei the Deathless are three of the greatest.
