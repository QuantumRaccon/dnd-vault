## Description

>A beautiful figure made of water and plants steps from the lake and smiles.

Crinaea are nymph-like water fey that inhabit small bodies of water such as wells and fountains.
**_Water-bound Fey_**. Similar to dryads, crinaea are bound to a body of water which becomes their home and focal point. Unlike dryads, crinaea can choose to be bound to a water source and can change which water source they call home. A crinaea must submerge itself in its bound water source every day or suffer. As long as the water source stays pure and the crinaea never travels more than a mile from it, the crinaea can live indefinitely. If its home water source is ever dried up or destroyed, the crinaea quickly fades until it finds a new home or dies.

**_Friendly but Poisonous_**. One of the most gregarious fey, the crinaea enjoys long conversations with intelligent creatures. The crinaea is often well-versed in the goings-on around its home and happily shares such information with friendly creatures. It offers its pure water to those in need and those who are polite, but woe be unto those who anger the fey after having tasted its water, as the crinaea can poison any water taken from its home.
