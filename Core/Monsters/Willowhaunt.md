## Description
---
>The ghostly image of a healthy willow overlays a smaller tree composed of bones. Piles of bones litter the ground at its base.

**_Death Tree_**. When victims of murder or other violent deaths die in view of an otherwise healthy willow tree, their spirits flock to the tree. This destroys the willow and causes it to return as a mockery of a living tree. The willowhaunt projects an image of its former appearance to put creatures at ease, at least long enough to convince them to approach.

**_Thirst for Blood_**. Willowhaunts thrive best in blood-soaked soil. They incite murderousness in those who come near by telepathically whispering conspiracies about a creature's allies. The willowhaunts encourage their victims to make small sacrifices to the willows, ensuring the willowhaunt's soil remains bloody.

**_Attractive to Death Cults_**. Swamp-based death cults cherish the discovery of a willowhaunt and sacrifice victims to create a grove of willowhaunts. Perversely, a willowhaunt prefers blood shed by unwilling creatures, and it demands the cultists bring victims it can force into a fight.

**_Undead Nature_**. The willowhaunt doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
