## Description

>An amber-skinned angelic figure clad in leather armor spreads its white wings as it takes a long pull from an enormous drinking horn.

Mead archons are the emissaries of deities who enjoy battle and strong drink.
**_Fight Hard, Party Harder_**. Mead archons are good-natured, bombastic warriors who inspire others in battle with their bravery and feats of strength. In times of desperation, a god sends these archons to bolster the ranks of mortal soldiers who serve the deity's cause. If the day is won, mead archons relish staying on the Material Plane to celebrate, drinking ale, bellowing songs, and sharing stories of victory.

**_Divine Trainers_**. When a mortal champion of a deity is part of an athletic competition or important battle, a mead archon is often sent to help prepare the mortal for the event. Mead archons are tough but encouraging trainers who enjoy celebrating wins and drinking away losses.

**_Immortal Nature_**. The mead archon doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
