## Description
---
_A humanoid figure teeters, clutching both ends of a curious scroll. The curled eldritch parchment is marked with strange, alien glyphs on one side that pulsate with an arcane glow, illuminating the figure's twisted face. Tendrils of opalescent light snake out from the surface of the bizarre scroll as the ensorcelled figure staggers forward._

**_Arcane Guardians_**.  A weirding scroll is a grim construct crafted from a length of magically-treated humanoid skin. This morbid parchment is prepared by a master surgeon before undergoing certain profane and secret rites that imbue the scroll with formidable mind-warping abilities. This surreptitious construct lies in wait for a living creature to come along and serve as an unwilling surrogate for its creator's commands.

**_Nimbused Puppeteers_**. The mobility of this odd artifice is limited. When a weirding scroll isn't flitting on the wind in a form of mock lifelessness, it employs a powerful domination, which manifests as an eerie tangle of light that entwines its victim.

**_Athenaeum Wardens_**.  The first weirding scrolls were constructed to help protect the massive libraries of an ancient race of sorcerer kings. Since then, the riddle of their creation has fallen into the hands of only the most studious of artificers. 

**_Construct Nature_**.  A weirding scroll doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
