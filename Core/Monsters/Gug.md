## Description
---
_The gugs are giants of the underworld, long since banished into dark realms for their worship of the eldest and foulest gods._

**_Underworld Godlings_**. Gugs enjoy smashing and devouring lesser creatures, and their burbling and grunting speech displays a surprising and malign intelligence to those few who can understand it. Gugs are occasionally worshipped by tribes of derro, and their strange underworld cities are filled with filled with esoteric monoliths and constructs.

**_Nocturnal Raiders_**. While gugs are banished into the underworld in mortal realms, they regularly flout this prohibition by raiding the surface by night. They also spend much time in the Dreamlands and the Ethereal plane; some gug warlocks and sorcerers are said to travel the planes with entourages of fext or noctiny.

**_Prey on Ghouls_**. Gugs devour ghouls and darakhul as their preferred foodstuffs. When these are not available, they seem to prefer carrion and particular varieties of psychotropic mushrooms, as well as something that is best described as candied bats.
