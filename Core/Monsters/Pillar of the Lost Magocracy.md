## Description
---
_This pale gray, angular, stone column dominates the horizon, eldritch sigils decorating its surface. As night descends, these glyphs glow with an unearthly pinkish-white light._

**_Hazards of the Wastes_**. These strange pillars date back to ancient wizard kingdoms destroyed in ancient arcane wars. Each holds the insane spirit of a wizard slain during the wars. Most of the time, these spirits are half-asleep, and the pillars act as hazards, discharging magical energy at sunset and sunrise.

**_Awakened Spirits_**. When the stars are right, however, the spirit of the ancient mage within the pillar awakens. Sworn to defend its magocracy, the spirit views nearby creatures as agents of a rival magocracy. The pillar's sigils glow brightly as it unleashes warped magic on nearby creatures.

>These bizarre columns are all that is left of Uxloon, one of the nine ancient magocracies of the Wasted West. Uxloon was destroyed in the Great Mage Wars by the terrifying Walker Pah'draguusthlai, who was summoned by Enkada Pishtuhk. The pillars are either the animated gravestones of Uxloon's council of wizards, or perhaps creations of the [[Dust Goblin \|dust goblin]] (Tome of Beasts) shamans or [[Void Speaker \|void speakers]].
