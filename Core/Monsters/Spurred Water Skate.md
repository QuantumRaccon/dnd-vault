## Description
---
The spurred water skate is a diurnal carnivore. It has weak mandibles, but the adaptations enabling it to move on the water make it a powerful hunter. The distribution of the spurred water skate's weight, along with leg bristles that create and hold air bubbles at the surface, allow it to stand on top of even moderately choppy water and move without sinking. The insect's sharp forelimbs are powerful enough to kill weaker prey outright, but it prefers to use its limbs to grasp targets and submerge them until they drown.

Because spurred water skates move effortlessly across wet surfaces, they are desirable mounts in the swamps and marshes they inhabit. [[Cueyatl]] (Creature Codex) and smaller lizardfolk train and ride the insects.
