## Description
---
_These small, winged faeries appear to be made out of gray mist, and can conceal themselves completely in the fogbanks and clouds enshrouding their mountainous lairs._

**_Mist Dancers_**. These evil and cunning faeries (whose name means "mist dancers" in Old Elvish) overcome their victims by seeping into their lungs and choking them on the bereginyas's foul essence.

**_Mountain Spirits_**. They are most commonly found in the highest mountain ranges, often above the treeline, but they can be encountered in any foggy or misty mountainous region. Shepherds and goatherds often leave bits of milk or cheese to placate them; these offerings are certainly welcome during the spring lambing season.
