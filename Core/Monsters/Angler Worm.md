## Description
---
_As patient as a fisherman, the angler worm lights a beacon in the darkness and waits for its next meal._

**_Silk Snares_**. The angler worm burrows into the ceilings of caves and tunnels, where it creates snares from strong silk threads coated with sticky mucus. It then lures prey into its snares while remaining safely hidden itself, emerging only to feed. With dozens of snares, food always comes to the angler worm eventually.
