## Description
---
_An enormous horned demon with a hide the color of burnt blood, a fulad-zereh's body is encased in red armor that has blackened through the ages._

**_Abyssal Officers_**. Lieutenants of demon armies, fulad-zereh tower over their allies and enemies alike. Fuladâ€‘zereh are violent and bloodthirsty demons who have fought for centuries to attain their forms and power, or who are elevated by demon lords during times of war.


**_Marked for Service_**. The armor that bolsters a fulad-zereh is forged to reflect the demon lord to which it is bound. It has been said that some fulad-zereh will abandon their demon lords rather than being demoted after battle. These rogue demons forge their own terrifying, nightmarish armor and sell their services to those willing to pay in souls.
