## Description
---
_Steam hisses from openings along the chest and jawline of a shining bronze man with enormous fists._

**_Refurbished Statues_**. Early bronze golems were crafted on a budget and had to use existing statues as a base. The interiors of these statues were hollowed out to fit the golem's internal steam boiler, and the leftover bronze was recast into an intimidating, stern-visaged head. Early bronze golems were used as arcane prison guards and guardians of secret temples.


**_Magic over Mechanics_**. Bronze golems were first developed as early prototypes of the [[Steam Golem \|steam golems]] (Tome of Beasts). These prototypes used arcane magic to smooth over inconsistencies in early steam technology, but rapid advancements in steam and clockwork mechanical engineering has made mass-producing mechanical golems much faster and cheaper than creating magical ones.


**_Valuable Bodies_**. A bronze golem weighs approximately 3,500 pounds and requires 3,000 gp worth of bronze and a steam engine worth 500 gp to construct. It also requires the replacement of magical reagents worth 1,500 gp every year to maintain the golem. Unlike a normal steam golem that requires coal and water to power it, these golems are powered by magical reagents, which perpetually generate burning steam within the bronze golem's internal boiler.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
