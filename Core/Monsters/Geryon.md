## Description
---


Geryon can have an action that allows him to summon [[minotaur]].

**_Sound the Horn (1/Day)_**. Geryon blows his horn, which causes **5d4** [[minotaur]] to appear in unoccupied spaces of his choice within 600 feet of him. The minotaurs roll initiative when they appear, and they obey his commands. They remain until they die or Geryon uses an action to dismiss any or all of them.
