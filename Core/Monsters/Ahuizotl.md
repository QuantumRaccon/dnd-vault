## Description
---
_Its hide black and rubbery, the ahuizotl's dark hair bristles into clumps of sharp spikes to protect it. The creature's long tail ends in a clawed hand, which it uses to grab and drag prey underwater._

**_Hunger for Flesh_**. The ahuizotl is a carnivorous hunter who feasts upon the flesh and bones of living creatures. It savors teeth, eyes, and fingernails the most, and villages have discovered mounds of remains by local lakes missing only those pieces.

**_Snatch Thieves_**. Ahuizotl are not always killers. Frequently they snatch a mirror, a banner, a fine bucket, or a bit of jewelry from a nobleman or servant down by the water. Ahuizotl collect these treasures and sometimes give them to [[cueyatl]] priests ([[cueyatl sea priest \|sea]], [[cueyatl moon priest \|moon]]) as offerings to the water gods.
