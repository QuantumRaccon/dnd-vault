## Description
---
Necromancers use their power over the undead to conjure servants and to poison, enfeeble, and kill foes with gleeful abandon. They are almost always accompanied by a group of zombies or skeletons; these are more likely to be mold zombies (see page 395), clacking skeletons (see page 340), or other variant undead for necromancers who have had time to establish a work site, pillage vaults and cemeteries, and hone their dark craft. They regularly use poison and poisonous traps and spells, as their undead companions are immune to such effects.
