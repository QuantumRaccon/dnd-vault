## Description
---
_A grinning man brandishes a staff surmounted by a rune-covered skull. Blasphemous sigils adorn his clothes, and ashes stain his skin a sickly gray._

Noctiny are wretched humanoids corrupted by fell power. Their skin is sallow and gaunt even before they smear it with ash, bone dust, and worse materials to wash all living color from their bodies. The noctiny embrace all manner of blasphemous and taboo behaviors to please their masters.

**_Pyramid of Power_**. The noctiny's lust for power drives them away from decency and reason. They are initiates who form the lowest rung of fext society. They swear themselves into service to the undead fext as thugs, servants, acolytes, and cannon fodder, and in exchange draw a trickle of power for themselves.

**_A Race Apart_**. Though they arise from any humanoid stock, the noctiny are corrupted by the powers they serve. Noctiny retain the cosmetic traits that identify their original race if one looks hard enough, but any connection they once had to their fellows is overpowered by their transformation into noctiny.
