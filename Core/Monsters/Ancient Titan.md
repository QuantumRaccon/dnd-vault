## Description
---
_Radiating a powerful presence, this towering humanoid has sharpedged features that seem hewn from ancient stone._

**_Children of the Gods_**. Ancient titans are the surviving immortal children of an early primordial god. They fled to the wilds after a divine war, where they founded an empire that lasted thousands of years before plague brought about its collapse.

**_Sea God's Servants_**. A few ancient titans still dwell in the ocean realm, spared by the sea god in exchange for eternal servitude. Ancient titans have long, glossy hair, usually black, red, or silver, and they stand 60 feet tall and weigh over 20 tons.

**_Friends to Dragons_**. Ancient titans have a strong rapport with wind and sea dragons, as well as gold, silver, and mithral dragons.
