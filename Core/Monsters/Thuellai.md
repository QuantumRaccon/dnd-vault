## Description
---
_This raging cloud of animate mist and ice has icicle shards for eyes and claws. In battle or when hunting, a theullai howls like a dozen screaming banshees._

**_Servants of Boreas_**. These fast-flying creatures of air and ice were created by the lord of the north wind, Boreas, to be his heralds, assassins, and hunting hounds. They appear as a swirling blizzard, often blending in with snowstorms to surprise their victims.

**_Terrifying Blizzards_**. Thuellai love to engulf creatures in their blizzards, to lash buildings with ice and cold, and to trigger avalanches with their whirlwinds. They thrive on destruction and fear, and they share their master's unpredictable nature.

**_Immune to Steel_**. Northerners especially fear the thuellai because of their resistance to mundane steel, their terrifying howls, and their ability to cause madness.
