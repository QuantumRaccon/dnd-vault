## Description
---
_Five reptilian heads upon long necks rise from the murky surface of the water. Sizzling venom drips from each gaping maw._

The venom maw hydra lurks in sulfurous swamps and near areas of high geothermal activity, poisoning the hot springs and lakes where it dwells.

**_Voracious Appetite_**. The venom maw hydra takes advantage of the sanctuary its warm water home promises to nearby fauna, devouring any creature that comes for warmth or a drink and leaving desolation in its wake.

**_Deadly From Afar_**. Quick reflexes and the ability to spit vile secretions at range let it strike from the safety of its watery home.
