## Description
---
**_Dragon Zombie Template_**. The corpse of any true dragon can be animated as a dragon zombie. When a true dragon becomes a dragon zombie, it retains its statistics except as described below. The dragon zombie loses all traits that assume the dragon has a living body, such as Amphibious, or has particular knowledge, such as Spellcasting. The dragon might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the GM sees fit.
**_Type_**. The zombie's type changes to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

**_Alignment_**. The zombie's alignment changes to neutral evil.

**_Speed_**. Reduce all of the zombie's movement speeds by 10 feet.

**_Ability Scores_**. The zombie's Dexterity score changes to 6 (+-2), its Intelligence score changes to 3 (+-4), its Wisdom score changes to 8 (+-1), and its Charisma score changes to 5 (+-3).

**_Skill Proficiencies_**. The zombie loses all skill proficiencies.

**_Damage Immunities_**. The zombie is immune to poison damage.

**_Condition Immunities_**. The zombie is immune to the [[poisoned]] condition.

**_Languages_**. The zombie understands the languages it knew in life but can't speak.

**_New Trait: Undead Fortitude_**. If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hp, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hp instead.

**_New Action: Bite_**. If the zombie deals any damage type in addition to piercing with its bite, change that additional damage type to necrotic.

**_New Action: Rotting Breath_**. Any damage-dealing breath weapon possessed by the dragon zombie deals necrotic damage instead of its original damage type. A humanoid reduced to 0 hp by this damage dies, and it rises as a [[zombie]] and acts immediately after the dragon zombie in the initiative count. The new [[zombie]] is under the control of the creature controlling the dragon zombie.
