## Description
---
_The beautiful horse twitches slightly before it changes into a humanoid creature with a horse's head. Its beauty is transfixing despite the razor-sharp teeth._

**_A Dark Beast of Legend_**.  The water horse often crosses to the mortal world via water bridges. A horse-headed humanoid in its natural form, the water horse can also appear as a fetching humanoid or a beautiful riding horse.

**_An Aquatic Danger_**.  While not a mindless killer, the water horse, also known as the each-uisge, has a taste for human flesh, and those who dwell in the mortal world eat well. They live on the shores of seas or lakes, often posing as fisher-folk or sailors to blend in with the local population. They use their charms and guile to draw victims back to their lair to feast. Water horses are particularly dangerous when a mated pair have young that need to be fed. While water horses create homes at the edge of the water, most have a secret lair beneath the surface.
