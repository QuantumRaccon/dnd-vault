## Description
---
_The dark, vague outline of a person flickers in the gloom._

The restless, angry spirits of those who have met a violent end, phantoms wander the night, vacillating between confusion, outrage, and misery.

**_Bewildered Victims_**. Those who have attempted communication with phantoms report that the phantoms have little, if any, awareness of their undead state, and they seem disoriented and permanently trapped in the traumatic moments surrounding their deaths.

**_Accidental Killers_**. Phantoms often approach the living with what seems like benign intent, but, when they draw close, they grab hold of living creatures and give voice to a terrifying, unearthly moan. They seem to be attempting communication, but, when their actions lead to the death of the creature, they wander away to find another.

**_Undead Nature_**. A phantom doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
