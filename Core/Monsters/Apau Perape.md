## Description
---
_Sharp teeth fill this large, demonic ape's mouth. Its long, muscular arms stretch to the ground, ending in wickedly curved claws._

**_Servants of Fire_**. These black-furred gorilla demons serve only Mechuiti, the demon lord of fire and apes. Their final loyalty is unshakable, though sometimes they serve others for a timeâ€”and they have no fear of fire, gleefully setting fire to villages and crops if their master is snubbed or insulted.

**_Fearless Attackers_**. The apau perape are fearless and savage, living for battle. Once in combat, their morale never breaks. Like their master, they have an insatiable hunger and do not leave any dead behind, consuming even their bones.

**_Eyes of Fire_**. When this demon is angered, its eyes glow a deep, disturbing red, unlike any natural ape.




The apau perape chooses what to summon and attempts a magical summoning. The apau perape has a 50 percent chance of summoning one apau perape or one giant ape.
