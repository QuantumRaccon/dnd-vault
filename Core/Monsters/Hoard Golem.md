## Description
---
_A hoard golem is a pile of gold, jewelry, and weapons that can rise on its own like a tidal wave of riches, with a cold and determined face. A hoard golem can crash down with the weight of a fortune, flattening everything in its path._

**_Dragon Fears Made Real_**. The hoard golems were born from the paranoia of dragons. Despite their great physical and intellectual power, dragons are always suspicious of any creature willing to work for them. The first hoard golem was created when a dragon realized that there could be no guardian more trustworthy with its hoard than the hoard itself. Since then, the secret of hoard golem construction has emerged, and rich nobles have followed suit, enchanting their wealth to defend itself from thieves.

**_Patient Homebodies_**. As constructs, hoard golems are mindless, lying in wait for anyone other than their creator to come within striking distance. In the case of evil dragons, this may include the wyrmlings of dragon parents looking to establish dominance in the family. Hoard golems fight to the death, but they rarely leave the rooms they inhabit for fear that clever treasure hunters might trick the hoard into walking itself right out of the owner's den.

**_Silent and Wealthy_**. Hoard golems cannot speak. A hoard golem is 25 feet tall and weighs 20,000 lb. A hoard golem's body is composed of items—copper, silver, gold, works of art, armor, weapons, and magical items—worth at least 5,000 gp.
