## Description
---
_This ashen-colored giant moth flies freely through flame and smoke. Its large eyes flicker from yellow to orange as it regards possible prey._

**_Dwellers in the Char_**. Sootwings are most commonly found in the recently burned regions of forests or grasslands, though some have been seen flapping near volcanoes. They lay their eggs in the charred remains of old trees, and their larvae feed on the burned wood.
