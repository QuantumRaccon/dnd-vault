## Description
---
_A globe of impenetrable darkness slithers along the floor, rippling as deep a black as can be seen by the naked eye._

Shadow oozes are pitch-black gelatinous blobs that swallow all nearby light. They yearn to destroy any place that is not the Plane of Shadow.

**_Liquid Shadow_**. When some of the Plane of Shadow leaks into another world, it animates into one or more shadow oozes. These creatures despise living in a place that is not the Plane of Shadow and seek to consume almost any other creature they come across. This need to consume drives the oozes. Instinct tells them that if they grow large enough, they can cover the world in darkness and transform it into a second Plane of Shadow. If the ooze is sent back to the Plane of Shadow, it rejoins with the essence of that plane and no longer exists as an ooze.

**_Guards of Shadow Fey_**. Shadow oozes show no interest in devouring shadow fey. As a result, shadow fey use shadow oozes to serve as guardians of their greatest treasures and most hidden fortresses. The shadow fey feed prisoners to the oozes and release the gelatinous monsters when intruders are afoot or when non-ooze guards are resting.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A shadow ooze doesn't require sleep.
