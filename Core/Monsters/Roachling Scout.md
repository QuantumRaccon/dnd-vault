## Description
---
_With carapace dulled and with antennae sharp, a roaching scout scuttles quietly through shadow and along walls, always evading notice while observing all around it. Their speed and stealth combine to cover a lot of territory._

**_Nose for Sugar_**. Roachling scouts hunt down and retrieve food and other goods their people have trouble attaining due to their appearance and social station. Scouts have an uncanny knack for locating sugar, which is a vital ingredient in a roachling's diet. Their climbing ability and size also make roachling scouts excellent spies.

**_Watchers_**. While most roachling scouts are sent to search and find, they are also excellent at watching and waiting. Some cults of [[Akyishigal]] (Tome of Beasts) or [[Arbeyach]] employ them as lookouts and informants.

**_Prone to Distraction_**. Roachling scouts can be easy to lead astray with a new scent, a delectable bit of rotting fruit, or a mysterious tune. Their curiosity is their greatest weakness.
