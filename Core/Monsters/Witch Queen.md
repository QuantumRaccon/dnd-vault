## Description
---
_The unfocused dark eyes and twisted smile of the small, dwarf-like creature at first make her seem insane, yet harmless. Then the magic that pours from her proves that assumption terribly wrong._

**_Cold, Calculating Insanity_**. The derro witch queen sits at the center of an entire clan of derro, turning the mad dreams and odd behaviors of each individual into action. Like the rest of her clan, the inscrutable thoughts and actions of the derro witch queen may seem random and chaotic, but at their core the derro find themselves moving toward a common goal.


**_Ruler and Servant_**. The witch queen looks different from other derro. Her pale skin and dark raven hair set her apart, as do her cold, black-pupiled eyes. These changes come over the witch queen upon the death of the previous witch queen, when the mad soul of the witch queen transfers from one host to the next. While outsiders may think the witch queen rules her clan, the opposite is true. The witch queen responds to the unfocused, rambling thoughts of each member of her clan. Her synchronicity with every member of the clan informs all her actions and decisions, making her the maddest of the mad.
