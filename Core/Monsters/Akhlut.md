## Description
---
>Possessing the body, head, and tail of a killer whale and the powerful legs of a huge wolf, the akhlut is the alpha predator of the polar landscape. Truly personifying the term "seawolf," these intelligent and resilient creatures travel freely between the land and sea in search of prey.

Akhluts are the masters of their domain. Though they have been seen across all of the world's oceans and many of its coastlines, akhluts are most comfortable in cold regions with easy access to the sea. Because their pods can reach almost a dozen members, anything is fair game from reindeer and seals to mammoths and whales. The only beings powerful enough, or foolhardy enough, to evict a pod of akhluts from their territory are dragons and other akhluts.
**_Playful Predators_**. Akhluts possess undeniable cunning and inquisitiveness, with no two pods using the same strategies to solve problems or hunt prey. Easily bored, akhluts crave stimulation and are known to follow ships and caravans for miles in the hopes that someone might provide something new or exciting to experience. They can be especially mischievous, freeing fish and game from traps purely to hunt the creatures themselves.

**_Dangerous Steeds_**. The akhlut's natural power, intelligence, and versatility make them incredibly desirable mounts, but the effort to tame one of these creatures is dangerous and not to be taken lightly. Even akhluts who have been mounts for years are willful enough to assert themselves from time to time. With a great deal of patience and a little luck, akhluts can become fiercely loyal and protective companions.
