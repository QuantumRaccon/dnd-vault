## Description
---
_This creature, roughly the size of a hog, roots in the soil with tusks pointing downward from its upper jaw. The middle joints of its forelimbs point outward, like a lizard, and its thick, gray hide is sparsely covered with wiry hair down its back to its stubby tail. It makes a grunting, muttering sound to itself._

Often used as guard animals by kobolds in warmer climes, the lystrosaurus has a reputation as a sturdy and self-sufficient companion. When not working in some capacity, it rips up vegetation and masticates the day away. At night, it digs shallow burrows in the ground to sleep, which are occasionally expanded upon by its masters.
