## Description
---
>Wisps of frosty air rise from the amorphous, quivering blue puddle. Bits of ice cling to the edges, and the surface has an almost crystalline appearance.

**_Mountainous Regions_**. Sapphire jellies are at home in glacial and mountainous regions among rocks and ice. They are just as likely to be found aboveground as below, but they avoid regions that are warm or dry. They tend to avoid large settlements of warm-blooded creatures, as such creatures consider them an active threat and often seek to destroy them. They prefer the company of creatures not bothered by the cold.

**_Unnaturally Cold_**. Sapphire jellies are extremely cold, freezing water and objects they encounter on contact. Creatures that are caught within them or hit with their attacks are immediately chilled to the bone, and those who are killed by them are permanently transformed into undead. Sapphire jellies can often be found in areas with g{@creature glacial corrupter|ToB2|glacial corrupters, which more often than not were once their victims.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A sapphire jelly doesn't require sleep.
