## Description
---
_This swanlike creature's feathers are made of shining metal. When it inhales, the feathers on its chest glow red hot._

Eala are beautiful but deadly creatures native to the plane of Shadow. They grow feathers like their Material Plane counterparts, but their feathers are made of gleaming, razor.sharp metal.

**_Metallic Diet_**. Eala plumage displays a stunning mixture of metallic colors, which vary depending on their diet. An eala uses its fire breath to melt metals with low melting points such as gold, silver, lead, copper, and bronze. The eala consumes the molten metal, some of which migrates into the creature's deadly feathers. Eala that display primarily or entirely a single color are highly prized.

> [!INFO] Eala in Midgard
>Eala are favorites of Sarastra, the Queen of Night and Magic, a ruler of the shadow fey. She is partial to jet black eala; all such specimens are brought to her flock at the Winter Palace, and those who bring them rewarded with a magical dagger and the title and status of "Honored Eala Catcher" or (for multiples) "Lord or Lady of Black Feathers."
