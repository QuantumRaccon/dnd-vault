## Description
---
_An enraged mass of malcontents storms across the tavern, overturning tables, busting bottles, and browbeating innocent patrons._

The jovial peace of a drinking establishment can transform into a whirlwind of chaos and violence in a mere moment, and no one caught in the middle of a bar brawl can hope to evade it.

**_Mob Brutality_**. A bar brawl arises suddenly and violently, often after a vile insult is lobbed or an accusation of cheating is lodged. Once enraged, the bar brawl attacks indiscriminately, assailing both the faultless and offending patrons with whatever weapons readily come to hand.
