## Description
---
>Standing on its back legs and holding a decapitated human head in its hands, this nightmarish creature resembles a gigantic squirrel with saber-like teeth, soulless black eyes, and hard, scaly skin. It chitters softly and eerily.

**_Forest Terrors_**. In the dark and foreboding forests of the north, tales are spun of terrible ogres, hags, evil wolves, and great arctic serpents, but humans and ogres alike fear the tembril, a savage monstrosity that feeds specifically on the eyes, tongues, and brains of humanoids. Resembling a squirrel the size of a bear, but with brown scales and immense claws and fangs, the tembril hunts sapient fey, humanoids, and giants exclusively, using its claws to eviscerate its opponent as its teeth punctures their skulls.

**_Head Collectors_**. The victim of a tembril attack is almost always found without its head, for the creature collects the severed cranium to devour the contents either immediately or at a later time. Tembrils store the heads in the long winter months, hiding them within the hollows of great trees or in other suitable locations and covering them in ice so they don't decompose. The decapitated bodies left behind make a meal for many forest-dwelling scavengers, and [[crow \|crows]], [[worg \|worgs]], and even [[ghoul \|ghouls]] have been known to follow in a tembril's wake, looking for a fresh feast.
