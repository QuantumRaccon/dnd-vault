## Description

>The pitiless eyes of this elven creature are black as pitch with neither white nor iris.

**_Born to Hunt_**. Mountain nymphs claim to be the children of gods associated with hunting and the moon. Whether this is true or not is unknown, but they are renowned as being some of the best stalkers and trappers among the fey. Newly created mountain nymphs, wearing leathers and carrying yew bows, form on the mountainside, fully-grown. The nymphs carry no arrows; every time they put a finger to any bowstring, a nocked arrow appears.

**_Despoilers of Despoilers_**. Mountain nymphs despise mortals who disrupt the natural order. Those who take or use more natural resources than they need while in a mountain nymph's territory risk becoming the target of her wrath. The raising of a settlement in a mountain nymph's territory will attract her immediate attention. The ruins of a failed mountain settlement may be the work of a mountain nymph that has taken umbrage at the community's excessive use of the local timber and ore.

**_Relentless Stalkers_**. Little can be done to deter a mountain nymph once it has set its sights on a quarry. They have been known to track their prey far from their native mountains, across continents and into mortal cities. When a nymph catches up to her mark, she harries it without mercy or remorse. A nymph's mark, assuming it has done nothing to offend or harm the nymph, can throw the nymph off its tail by exiting her territory and leaving tribute of freshly hunted meat and strong drink.

>In the Cloudwall Mountains, the mountain nymph Arshea wages a one-person war against worshippers of Marena. She is said to be seeking companions for a large-scale push against the Red Sisterhood.
