## Description
---
_A rotting wind brings a chilling gust to the air, turning nearby foliage to rot and raising a sense of dread in all creatures in its path._

**_Air of Tombs_**. A rotting wind is an undead creature made up of the foul air and grave dust sloughed off by innumerable undead creatures within lost tombs and grand necropoli.

**_Scouts for Undead Armies_**. A rotting wind carries the foul stench of death upon it, sometimes flying before undead armies and tomb legions or circling around long-extinct cities and civilizations.

**_Withering Crops_**. Rotting winds sometimes drifts mindlessly across a moor or desert, blighting all life they find and leaving only famine and death in its wake. This is especially dangerous when they drift across fields full of crops; they can destroy an entire harvest in minutes.
