## Description
---
_What at first appears to be a dead creature of some sort reveals itself to be a gray-skinned, winged serpent whose body is covered in a bony exoskeleton. Slender and snakelike, its leathery wings cling to its body tightly as it slithers out from hiding._

Fierce in appearance and a formidable opponent, the skull drake is a scavenger and carrion eater. Though it enjoys chasing smaller scavengers away from a prize meal, it will flee at the first sign of a more powerful creature.

**_Wandering Scavenger_**. When left to its own devices, the skull drake travels many miles between places of death, regularly revisiting sites where it feasted previously. Poisoned pools, places of execution, cemeteries, and-with caution and speed-the lairs of creatures who drag their meals home with them. Circling vultures and crows draw a skull drake's attention, and a sizeable battlefield may become a temporary home for a skull drake until opportunity or threat drives it elsewhere. A skull drake prefers to sleep in piles of bones and corpses, using its bony protrusions to blend in. It spits a cloud of deadly gas at any creature coming too close or uses its long neck to strike like a snake.


**_Associate of Death_**. Skull drakes consider themselves natural companions to practitioners of the necromantic arts, viewing such partnerships as mutually beneficial. It provides both parties with a degree of protection, and it assures the drake regular feeding since it has no qualms about eating the rotten remains of failed projects.
