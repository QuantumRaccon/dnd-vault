## Description
---
_Wrapped up against the cold in thick furs and a head scarf, this ugly old crone has a hooked nose, blue-tinged skin and long, clawed fingers. She trudges through the snow, leaning heavily on a gnarled staff._

Snow hags live in the cold lands of the far north, making their homes in wooden cottages amidst the trees of the taiga or in remote mountainside caves.

**_Evil Whispers_**. Snow hags enjoy posing as kindly wise women, selling herbal remedies and lucky charms. These remedies will work at first, but their efficacy soon fades, prompting the buyer to ask for something more permanent. The hag is only too willing to help but will ask for a favor in return. This might involve spreading gossip about another villager or playing a "harmless" prank on a neighbor. Slowly but surely, things escalate until everyone in the village is at each other's throats, much to the hag's delight.


**_Exiled for Ugliness_**. The first snow hags were daughters of the [[Snow Queen]] (Tome of Beasts), fathered by a hill giant lover she denies ever knowing. Appalled by their ugliness, the Snow Queen threw her offspring into the frozen wastes where they live to this day.


**_Mothers of Beauty_**. Snow hags reproduce by stealing human infants and eating them. A year and a day after consuming the infant, the hag gives birth to a beautiful [[ice maiden]] (Tome of Beasts). The magical kiss of an ice maiden freezes the heart of a mortal, putting it under her spell, but this magic can be broken by the kiss of the victim's true love. If an ice maiden loses seven lovers in this way, she transforms into a snow hag.
