## Description
---
>This ghostly humanoid's hands end in frozen claws. Water drips from the claws, freezing before it hits the ground.

**_Forlorn Spirits_**. Chill haunts arise from the corpses of humanoids that froze to death. While most chill haunts derive from those who died alone in the cold, stories tell of entire families or villages returning as chill haunts. Because of the intensity of their demise, chill haunts dread cold and flee when targeted by cold magic.

**_Hungry for Body Heat_**. The chill haunt's disdain for cold leads it to seek out warm buildings or open fires. While ambient heat or direct contact with fire diminishes its shivering and restores wounds it has received in combat, it craves heat from living creatures. Contact with the chill haunt sets off a deepening freeze in the victim, which is hard to reverse without the application of fire. The haunt comes into contact with living creatures to remember the feeling of warmth, and it does not care about the side effects of its touch. After it has drained the warmth from one creature, it immediately moves on to the next, ever-hungry.

**_Restless Undead_**. Destroying a chill haunt is only a temporary solution to the undead creature's depredations. Similar to a [[ghost]], a destroyed chill haunt returns to unlife 24 hours after its demise, attaining eternal rest only after being slain under a specific set of circumstances. For most chill haunts, the surest way to eternal rest is by coaxing the haunt to a warm building where it can sit by a hearth and nestle in blankets or furs. Though physical objects normally pass through the spectral creature, such conditions allow the coverings to conform to the shape of the haunt's former body. Moments later, the haunt lets out a contented sigh and winks out of existence.

**_Undead Nature_**. A chill haunt doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
