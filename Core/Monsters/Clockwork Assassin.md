## Description
---
_The ticking of their gears is all the warning some victims ever hear._

**_Single-minded Killers_**. A deadly, sentient tool and a lucrative investment for those who would hire them out, a clockwork assassin is a cold and efficient killer with no concern for its own well being.
> [!INFO] Clockwork Assassins in Midgard
>Creating or employing a clockwork assassin in the Free City of Zobeck is a capital crime. The gearforged oppose the creation of clockwork assassins not only because making an assassin requires the corruption of a soul gem, but also because the public might easily confuse honest gearforged with the lookâ€‘alike assassins. The temple of Rava and the gearforged both make efforts to uncover and destroy these constructs and those who make or employ them.
