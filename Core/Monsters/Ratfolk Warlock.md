## Description
---
_With filthy tunics and well-kept leathers, ratfolk slink through fights, always looking to flank, turn, or strike from behind. Their ability to work in large groups leads dwarves to despise them as a "lowly swarm of guttersnipes"—but they are effective._

Ratfolk survive by their wits and bargains. They are notorious for their willingness to work as mercenaries in large dungeon complexes and to strike pacts with far greater powers than themselves. Ratfolk mercenaries often work in tandem with warlocks acting as captains or sergeants for their employers.

**_Mercenary Flexibility_**. Ratfolk mercenaries can be bribed and corrupted with a large enough payment, but they like to say that they "stay bought until payday comes." Usually their loyalty is strong until matters turn against their current master—in some cases they have been known to offer their services to a foe mid-fight!

**_Night and Tunnel Specialists_**. Ratfolk mercenaries excel at work in dark, tight quarters, against cavern monsters, and in old dwarven holds. They also enjoy city kidnappings, guarding towers or dungeons, or silent moonlight scouting in hills or forests. They prefer to avoid working in full sun on open fields, though they are professional enough that they can create an effective ambush on riverbanks, in forest shadow, or elsewhere.

**_Overbold and Full of Themselves_**. Ratfolk warlocks tend to serve dark powers of shadow or diabolism, though sometimes they simply find the first power willing to make a pact for power (fey or genie-infused ratfolk warlocks are not unknown). The influx of power generally makes ratfolk warlocks insufferably bold, snide, and arrogant—they are convinced that their arcane power makes them the smartest, strongest, and handsomest ratfolk ever to slink through a darkened alley.

**_Staves and Amulets_**. As tokens of their pact, ratfolk warlocks always carry or display a profusion of decorated staves, gilded amulets, or clinking silver sigils and rune‑encrusted bells. They are notably less stealthy than most ratfolk.
