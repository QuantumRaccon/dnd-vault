## Description
---
_A tiny devil with red scales and wings of fire flits around the area, laughing as it ignites everything with a touch. The creature reeks of sulfur and brimstone._

Fire imps are one of the lowest forms of devils, below even common imps. They are mischievous troublemakers who desire only to ignite the multiverse.

**_Contained Insanity_**. While fire imps are demented arsonists, they are still devils and follow the chain of command. When the imps are not starting fires, they fidget, play with nearby utilitarian flames, and beg for permission to use their destructive abilities like whiny children. Glee strikes when the imps set something on fire, and they often go overboard, burning anything they can get away with.


**_Distract and Weaken_**. Devils send fire imps to a fortified location to cause chaos and weaken defenses. Demons recognize the havoc the tiny fiends cause and know to expect a devil attack soon after the arrival of fire imps.


**_Favored by Efreeti_**. Efreeti commonly hire fire imps as henchmen. The devils serve as spies, saboteurs, and guards in exchange for trips to the Plane of Fire, the most beautiful place in the multiverse to a fire imp. Efreeti often make the imps set fires to the property of nobles so that the genie can save the day...for a price.
