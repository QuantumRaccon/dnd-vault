## Description
---
>Covered in a mix of hard, blue-white scales and patches of silvery-blue fur, this dragon radiates a savage belligerence. Its amber eyes gleam with primal fury as it stretches its wings, sending a shower of burning sparks sizzling onto the ground.

**_Paradoxical Predators_**. Boreal dragons inhabit the arctic and alpine places of the world, from snow-capped conifer forests and frigid mountain peaks to flat, icy plains and polar seas. Unlike white or silver dragons, however, boreal dragons are not creatures of cold but rather of heat and flames. Their breath is filled with burning embers, and their preferred lairs contain some sort of natural heat source. While this contradiction has puzzled many scholars of draconic lore, boreal dragons are unconcerned about such trivial matters and are likely to devour any sage or wizard impertinent enough to question their choice of habitat.

**_Dragons of Rage_**. Boreal dragons are among the most straightforward of all true dragons, driven by simple necessities like hunting and mating. They hate most other dragons with a passion and war constantly with those that share their arctic homeland, driving off or killing any dragons they encounter. Boreal dragons are truculent creatures and love nothing better than getting into a fight; however, they do not target defenseless creatures or those far weaker than themselves unless they are hunting for food. Because they respect strength above all else, a creature can gain a boreal dragon's admiration through acts of intense bravery or slaughter. In particular, the dragons are fond of large arctic predators, such as saber-toothed tigers and polar bears, and often invite the creatures to live in their lairs.


**_A Boreal Dragon's Lair_**. Boreal dragons make their home in arctic or subarctic regions, particularly areas warmed by geothermal activity. Suitable sites for their lairs include cliffs above magma deposits or fissures, large caves at the edge of volcanic craters or near hot springs, or the abandoned outposts of fire giants. Boreal dragons also enjoy taking over the lairs of other dragons, particularly those they have personally slain or driven out.
