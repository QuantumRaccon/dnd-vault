## Description
---
These large and exaggerated versions of mundane oak, pine, or willow trees boast steel-hard trunks and brightly glowing foliage. The bark of these trees form placid visages that stare out mutely at the surrounding landscape. While only three varieties have been found, priests and scholars speculate that the spirited trees could manifest in any arboreal form. Animals happily make homes in the branches and roots of the alabaster trees, where they enjoy protection and unnaturally long lives.}

**_Stars in the Branches_**. An alabaster tree welcomes kindâ€‘hearted and good-aligned creatures by illuminating its leaves and needles with pulses of brilliant white light. During this time, the tree will attempt to communicate with the creature for the purpose of sharing information about the goings-on in the region.

**_Protectors_**. Alabaster trees are the protectors of a lustrating grove. Their ability to move quickly for short periods of time and their tough trunks make them formidable combatants. The trees suffer no evil or trickery and happily toss interlopers out of the grove.
