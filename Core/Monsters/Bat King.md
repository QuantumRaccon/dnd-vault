## Description
---
_A dark-skinned man of small stature wearing a voluminous gray robe squints about curiously, his upturned nose doing the expression no favors. With his thick, black hair and beard worn close-cropped, he looks to be some sort of monk or scholar._

**_Redeemer_**. The sworn foe of [[Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire \|Camazotz]] (Tome of Beasts), the great corruptor of his children, the Bat King  spends much of his time devising ways to dispatch the demon lord's many servants. His time in human form is spent conducting research to that end. He does, however, make good use of his bat form when eavesdropping.
**_Hit and Run_**. Traveling from land to land, searching the libraries and vaults of the great cities for anything that will aid him in his task, the Bat King returns often to the cities nearest to the jungles of the world. On that border between civilization and savagery, he flits to and fro, striking and fleeing. He has been killed many times, but his enemies have never dispatched him permanently.
**_Secret Ally_**. The Bat King knows his limits and is always looking to form alliances of mutual interest against his foes. He rarely reveals his identity to allies for the safety of all involved but is otherwise straightforward in his dealings.
> [!INFO] Bat King in Midgard
>The Bat King is the eternal enemy of [[Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire \|Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats]] (Tome of Beasts). Their struggle takes place in forms and areas largely invisible to daylight-dwellers but is fierce nonetheless. While Camazotz rules the underworld and fire, the Bat King's followers are found in forests, jungles, and caverns closer to the surface. Some cults of Camazotz seek to capture and corrupt the Bat King's followers, turning ordinary animals into the [[skin bat \|skin bats]] (Tome of Beasts) and [[giant vampire bat \|giant vampire bats]] found in service to various cults. The Bat King strives to keep his people free of their malign influences and seems to have an informal alliance with the [[Bear King]] (Tome of Beasts) and the bearfolk in the Shadow Realm and elsewhere.
