## Description
---
>This enormous, squat beast has a shaggy hide of ice. Two translucent horns protrude from its snout, the frontmost of which looks like a scimitar.

**_Elemental-Touched Rhino_**. A cryoceros resembles a woolly rhinoceros made of ice. Its thick, frozen hide protects the soft flesh at its core, and a layer of ice forms over its already formidable, keratinous horns. The creature's body is efficient at transferring warmth to its fleshy interior; fire still harms a cryoceros, but its icy form is not unduly damaged by fiery attacks. A cryoceros has a second stomach that stores ice it consumes. As a defense mechanism, the cryoceros can spew stinging, pulverized ice from this alternate stomach.

**_Slow Metabolisms_**. Cryoceroses survive on stunted grasses and other plants that thrive in the tundra, as well as ice and snow, to replenish their icy exteriors. Despite their size, they don't require a great deal of sustenance, and they conserve their energy by slowly grazing across frozen plains. Their ponderous movement fools the unwary into believing that distance equals safety. Indeed, cryoceroses endure much provocation before they decide to act, but they run at and spear or crush those who irritate them. Once their ire is up, they rarely give up pursuing the source of their anger; only by leaving their vast territories can one hope to escape them.

**_Cantankerous Mounts_**. Gentleness and a regular source of food temporarily earns the cryoceroses' trust, and patient humanoids can manage to train the creatures to accept riders. This works for convenience much more than for combat, since cryoceroses balk at fighting with loads on their backs. A cryoceros in combat with a rider either stands stock still until its rider dismounts or, worse, rolls over to throw its rider, often crushing the rider in the process. Because of this, most tribes who train cryoceroses use the creatures as beasts of burden rather than war mounts.
