## Description

>The grinning ghoul's mace drips with shadow as it chants prayers to its dark god. Another shadowy grin appears on top of the ghoul's and extends out, consuming all it touches.

**_Worshiper of Hunger_**. Vardesain, known as the Unsated God, is a god of death, hunger, and the undead. The bulk of his followers, especially in the deep caverns of the world, are undead. The most common of these followers are darakhul2014intelligent and civilized [[ghoul \|ghouls]]2014who share their lord's unholy hunger. The servants of the Unsated God act as civil officials, support the imperial army, and spread the faith (often by slaying intruding surface dwellers then recruiting them as newly risen undead).

**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The ghoul requires no air or sleep.
