## Description
---
>The fey lady's attendant stands by, waiting on her from the shadows. The lady voices her desire, and the attendant leaps into action, calling a phantasmal charger made of midnight and shadow.

**_Fey Stewards_**. The far dorocha manage the servants of the fey courts and, when tasked, carry out the more sinister biddings of their masters. Fey lords and ladies prize the far dorocha for their attention to detail and composed mien.

**_Abductor of Mortals_**. Sometimes called the "dark man" or "fear dorcha," these malicious fey are described in grim folk tales. Parents scare their children into obedience by telling bedtime stories of villains who ride black horses in the night and steal the ill-behaved away to lands of perpetual darkness. Woe betide the children who wake up to find they are the ones alone.
