## Description
---
_All the colors of the rainbow shimmer within a cloud. It coalesces into a vaguely humanoid form that smells of ozone and ash._

**_A Golem Without Form_**. The manastorm golem is the creation of a master wizard who harnesses the magic around it to create a construct without the need for materials; it makes the creature from magic itself. The golem is malleable and amorphous, expanding and contracting as needed, but it always reforms into a vaguely humanoid-shaped cloud of energy.


**_Intelligent and Communicative_**. The manastorm golem is unique among its cousins because it is given an inherent intelligence from its creator. This, and its ability to fly, makes it a perfect scout. The golem can fly somewhere, investigate the area, and return with information, conveying it to the golem's master via magical whispers.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
