## Description
---


Driders that were once drow spellcasters might retain their ability to cast spells. Such driders typically have a higher spellcasting ability (15 or 16) than other driders. Further, the drider gains the Spellcasting trait. A drider that was a drow divine spellcaster, therefore, could have a Wisdom of 16 (+3) and a Spellcasting trait as follows.

Spellcasting. The drider is a 7th-level spellcaster. Its spellcasting ability is Wisdom (spell save DC 14, **6** to hit with spell attacks). The drider has the following spells prepared from the cleric spell list:

- Cantrips (at will): [[poison spray]], [[thaumaturgy]]
- 1st level (4 slots): [[bane]], [[detect magic]], [[sanctuary]]
- 2nd level (3 slots): [[hold person]], [[silence]]
- 3rd level (3 slots): [[clairvoyance]], [[dispel magic]]
- 4th level (2 slots): [[divination]], [[freedom of movement]]
