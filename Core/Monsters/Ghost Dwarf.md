## Description
---
_The spectral visage of a wide-eyed dwarf stares out from the open visor of a suit of black platemail, muttering to itself._

**_From Hope to Horror_**. The risen shades of dwarven paladins and other would-be heroes who made holy war on the undead and lost, the ghost dwarves march by night, sent back to slay those who originally sent them.


**_Prayers Unanswered_**. The face of a ghost dwarf stares out from its black helm with a look of sheer terror, desperate and unguarded enough to horrify most dwarves. The echoes of their last words, of oaths in vain and pleadings with their gods, fill the air around them in a chilling whisper.


**_Instruments of Spite_**. More powerful undead take great pleasure in sending these shades back against their grieving kin. The ghost dwarves themselves often lead wights and other lesser undead into battle.


**_Undead Nature_**. A ghost dwarf doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
