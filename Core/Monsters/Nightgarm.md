## Description
---
_These humanoid creatures work with their lupine mother and their worg and winter wolf brothers and sisters to destroy human and dwarvish settlements. Their howls are songs of vengeance, and their fangs and jaws seem ready to swallow the world._

**_Champions of the Northern Packs_**. Created in a magical ritual performed over a pregnant worg by her packmates, nightgarms are always female and are always loyal followers of Fenris. They are dedicated to harassing servants of the gods, especially the northern gods of the sky, thunder, or wisdom. Their spawn infiltrate settlements to bring them down—treachery that always ends with a massed attack by wolves.

**_Carry Off Plunder_**. Nightgarms resemble enormous wolves, but up close their wide mouths, hate-filled eyes, and halfformed fingers give them away as something different from—and much worse than—worgs. They can wield items in their front paws and can walk on their hind limbs when necessary, though they are far swifter on four legs.

**_Impossibly Wide Jaws_**. A nightgarm's jaws can open to swallow corpses, living creatures, and items larger than themselves, a magical trick that happens in a matter of seconds.

**_Renegate Falsemen_**. One in every thirteen falsemen has the potential to escape their mother's influence. Roll **1d12** whenever the nightgarm spawns a falseman: On a roll of 1 they give birth to a renegade (the 13th spawn is always a renegade if it hasn't occurred yet this cycle). One day after its creation (and up to once per day thereafter), the renegade falseman can make a DC 14 Charisma saving throw. If successful, the controlling nightgarm's influence is broken; the falseman regains its original alignment and the charm effect ends (although not the empathic link). The renegade retains its other characteristics.
