## Description
---
>Hurtling down the street is a giant wheel, its spokes tipped with reddish flames that sputter and spark as it bounces along. Affixed to either side of the wheel by long strands of greasy black hair are the faces of devilish-looking humanoids, their eyes ablaze like embers. The two faces chortle and cry as the wheel approaches, fire leaping from their mouths.

**_Born of Heresy_**. Wanyudos are the souls of powerful lords condemned to an afterlife of burning torment after they refuted the teachings of the gods and were killed in battle or committed suicide. Prideful and violent monsters, wanyudos are lesser fiends in the grander schemes of Hell, a fact they vehemently resent.

**_Divine Hunters_**. While wanyudos hate all living creatures, the reserve their greatest hatred for creatures marked by a divine entity—such as clerics and paladins, or creatures wearing holy symbols—whom they blame for their cursed existence. When wandering by a monastery or temple, a wanyudo expends every effort to burn the structure to the ground and murder everyone within. Given this, temples and holy sites in areas known to be plagued by wanyudos often fireproof their buildings—and have a reliable source of water nearby, in case the worst should happen.

**_To Hell and Back_**. Wanyudos never stop moving, endlessly rolling along the roads and pathways between the Hells and the mortal world. Because of this, wanyudos know many secret ways into the planes.
