## Description
---
The avatar of Shoth is a gargantuan, oozing pile connected to two droths by viscous appendages. A massive pulsing zom sits in the center of its body, and it is from there that the laws and edicts of Shoth emanate. The avatar's zom is a powerful magical artifact, which stores, creates, and disseminates the rules and tenets of the shoth across the planes of existence. Through this zom, the avatar can communicate telepathically with any shoth over any distance and across any plane. The zom magically returns to Shoth if the avatar is slain.

**_Abandon or Persist_**. The avatar of Shoth is often called to worlds where the shoth have been unsuccessful in convincing a populace to dissolve with them. Though the shoth possess infinite patience, in certain circumstances Shoth determines it is no longer necessary to pursue a certain form of life. Alternatively, Shoth may decide to take extreme measures to encourage willingness to step into a zolv. On numerous occasions, Shoth has sent its avatar to destroy all other life on a world to force the reluctant race's hand.

**_the Avatar of shoth's lair_**. The Dripping Place is an enormous vessel that houses the avatar of Shoth itself. The massive ship is made from slime-exuding metal plates and is powered by mysterious, magical energy. The avatar pilots the ship from its central chamber. The Dripping Palace only arrives on worlds where the shoth have met extreme opposition. Wherever the palace goes, a force of oth paladins goes with it.
