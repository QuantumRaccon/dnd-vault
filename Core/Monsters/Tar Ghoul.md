## Description
---
_Decayed bodies emerge from a pit, covered with a thick, black ooze, showing their sharp teeth and hissing with hunger in their eyes._

When attacked with fire, tar ghouls often scream with joy as they burst into flames.

**_Burning Wish_**. Bored while under the service of a necromancer, an efreeti prince toyed with his master's creations to give them an edge against fiery spellcasters.


**_Flaming Horde_**. These ghouls roam the darkness in packs, hunting for fresh meat. They relish roasting their food as it screams in pain.


**_Bring your Own Fire_**. These creatures do not fear flame. They revel in the fear their victims experience as the victims realize the inferno will be their doom. Most of these ghouls wear pieces of flint on their rags to ignite themselves if their prey does not use fire against them.


**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The tar ghoul doesn't require air or sleep.
