## Description
---
_This elephant-sized beast has a pronounced snout with large canine teeth and claws like longswords. It spends most of its life slowly digesting its latest meal in its cool burrow._

**_Burrowers and Diggers_**. The carnivorous giant sloth lives in great dirt mounds dug to its satisfaction in hilly or grassland areas. Below the mound is a series of tunnels dug for escape and the storage of recent kills.

**_Hunter at the Water's Edge_**. These clever predators bury themselves in mud and grass and wait beside rivers, lakes, and ponds for prey to draw near. Once within range, the sloth moves with surprising speed and, like a trapdoor spider, rushes out to pull its prey back into its hunting hole.

**_Fetid Coats_**. The fur of the giant sloth is a matted nightmare of mud, blood, viscera, and mold. They apply fresh coats of mud when preparing to hunt, masking their scent for a short time.
