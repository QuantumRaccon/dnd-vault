## Description
---
_The edges of the figure's black armor plates glow red hot with the glare of hellfire leaking from them. The figure's eyes, glowing with that same hellfire, gleam from within its helmet as it swings its mighty sword._

Few devil souls hold the necessary dedication and temperament to become an infernal knight. The knight is a trusted advisor and servant to a powerful pit fiend or arch-devil.

**_Soul Stealer_**. An infernal knight's most terrifying aspect is its ability to steal the souls of its victims. The devil draws these souls into its dark blade and carries them back to its infernal master.


**_Tireless Pursuer_**. Powerful beings who make contracts with devils sometimes think they can avoid the worst consequences of infernal bargains. Infernal knights exist primarily to prove them wrong. A knight dispatched to reclaim an indebted soul stalks tirelessly across the multiverse in search of its quarry.


**_Relentless Nature_**. An infernal knight doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
