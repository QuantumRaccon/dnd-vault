## Description
---
_Chemosh is a 30-foot-tall, shark-headed human covered in red scales. People with hatred or ambition in their hearts hear his whispers as they look across the sea, goading them towards slaughter and tyranny._

As Lord of Conquest, Chemosh longs for perpetual war, a world that knows no peace anywhere.

**_Architect of Destruction_**. Despite his savage appearance, the Lord of Conquest is not a brutish beast. He possesses a cunning intellect and an instinctive understanding of military tactics that he shares with mortal generals in dreams. But the greatest of his powers is his knowledge of military engineering. Chemosh's formidable mind is incessantly dreaming new ways to kill more efficiently, more indiscriminately, and more painfully. Whenever the Lord of Conquest dreams up a new weapon, he sends it to the mind of an evoker, an engineer, or a trapsmith, who he then trusts to test, perfect, and iterate upon it.


**_Leviathan of Legend_**. Chemosh rarely meddles directly, preferring to prey on mortals' lust for power. When Chemosh does appear on the Material Plane, it is usually because he was called by his most powerful cultistsâ€”human warlords, sahuagin barons, and druids who wish to see the civilizations of the world razed and nature reborn anew. Chemosh may one day come to the mortal world of his own accord, because he fears his dream of endless war will be permanently quashed if he does not. On the Material Plane, he might choose to disguise himself as a kraken or other monstrous leviathan to prevent the gods from learning of his involvement and destroying him.


**_Marshal of the Bloodstained Sea_**. Chemosh lurks in the Bloodstained Sea, a layer of the Abyss containing a jet-black ocean which extends infinitely in all directions. Above its inky waters hangs a blood-red moon in a perpetual lunar eclipse. The souls of warmongers and cruel soldiers war forever beneath the surface of the sea, and Chemosh, the secret leader of all armies, plants jealousy and suspicions of conspiracy in the minds of the soldiers to pit themselves against each other for all eternity.


**_Chemosh's Lair_**. Chemosh resides in a palace of iron at the bottom of the Bloodstained Sea in the Abyss. The palace is shaped like a massive hermit crab and slowly plods across the ocean floor, surveying the endless war of damned spirits that fills the Bloodstained Sea.
