## Description
---
Kobolds come in many shapes and sizes, many of which have been detailed in other publications. There are a few kobold groups, however, that seem to have flown under the radar of those who study their culture and habitat. The following is a detailed study of five such groups within the kobold society.

**_Kobold Hunting Drake_**. With massive claws, thick broad shoulders and haunches, and powerful legs, the hunting drakes are built for climbing and pouncing. A beast that's all muscle, the drake stands three feet tall at the shoulders, grows to 12 feet from its nose to the end of its six-foot long tail end, and weighs up to 250 pounds. The drake is equally at home in mountains, forests, or the open plain. The hunting drake is a formidable foe, waiting to ambush from up high, ready to pounce down upon unsuspecting foes. Wise kobolds learned to domesticate the beasts as mounts, equipping them with special saddles that help the riders stay secure when the drake goes vertical and leaps horizontally.
