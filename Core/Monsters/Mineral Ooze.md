## Description
---
>Gray and amorphous, this creature skulks along the stone floor. Its body appears wet and oily, though an unusual crystalline pattern decorates the surface.

**_Subterranean Menace_**. A mineral ooze is a slime that hardens into solid rock after it engulfs its target, making escape much more difficult as it slowly digests the creature.

**_Earthy Consistency_**. The mineral ooze has a high concentration of silicates and crystal, which appear on the surface of the creature when it is in its gelatinous form. When it engulfs a creature, these minerals are pushed to the surface, where they harden quickly, trapping the creature. The ooze reverts to its liquid form after it has finished digesting the creature or if the creature escapes.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A mineral ooze doesn't require sleep.
