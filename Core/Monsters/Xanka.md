## Description
---
_This small metallic globe skitters about on many-jointed legs._

**_Cleaning Constructs_**. Created by gnomish tinkerers, xanka are constructs whose purpose is cleaning up their masters' messy workshops. Most xanka are built from copper, brass, or bronze, but gold, silver, and platinum varieties have been seen in the houses of nobles and rich merchants.
Xanka are not built for fighting—their instinct tells them to skitter for cover when danger threatens—but they will defend themselves when cornered.

**_Follow Commands_**. These constructs only obey simple commands that relate to the removal of garbage. They communicate with each other, but how they do it is unknown.

**_Absorb Matter_**. When a xanka touches matter with its globular body, it absorbs that matter into itself and breaks it down into energy, so that it can seek out more matter to absorb. Gnomes use them to keep the halls and streets clear of refuse. Xanka can absorb matter equaling half their body size every 6 seconds, but all this absorbing and converting doesn't alter the xanka's size.
