## Description
---
Dabbling in void magic often leads to unexpected and horrific results. A voidwracked mage is a spellcaster whose reckless experimentation has accidentally fused it with a portal to the Void itself. The driving purpose of a voidwracked mage is to increase the total entropy of the multiverse by consuming creatures with the event horizon to which it is fused. A voidwracked mage often serves more powerful void-touched creatures.
