## Description
---
_This ink-black, hulking beast looks cut from the darkness itself. It stands in the rough shape of a bear rearing up on its hind legs with slavering jaws dripping with a foul, black secretion. The antlers of a massive elk spread from either side of a pair of shining red eyes._

**_Darkness Begets Darkness_**. The spawn of Chernobog stalk places of horror, and their presence serves as a mark of evil deeds as surely as a trail of blood at the site of a murder.

**_Remnants of Malice_**. Spawn of Chernobog come into being for a myriad of reasons, not all of which can be laid at the feet of the Black God's followers. One might appear in the wake of a particularly cruel betrayal ending in murder. A battlefield marked by merciless acts might become the hunting grounds of a spawn of Chernobog. Acts of malice, the spreading of terror; these are sacred to the Lord of the Night, and a sufficient quality or quantity of either may birth his cruel progeny.

**_Indifferent Parentage_**. As one might imagine, a god of darkness, death, and destruction makes for an indifferent parent. Chernobog cares not what end his spawn may come to. So long as they spread fear and violence, they have served their purpose.
