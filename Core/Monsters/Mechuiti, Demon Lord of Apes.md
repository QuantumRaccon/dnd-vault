## Description
---
A yellow-green fire burns atop the head of this towering, red.furred demon, which resembles an enormous mandrill. It has massive, muscular arms tipped with razor-sharp claws, and a slavering jaw filled with huge fangs and tusks that curl back almost to its blue cheeks. Standing 25-feet-tall, Mechuiti can stand erect like a human or walk on its knuckles, like a great ape.

**_Bloodskull Island_**. After being expelled from the sweltering jungles and deadly swamps of the Hell of Cannibals, Mechuiti was coughed out of a volcanic portal into an island prison called Bloodskull. Here he schemes and plots his revenge while breeding demonic minions: tieflings, fiendish beasts, and behtu.

**_Bound But Dangerous_**. Despite being imprisoned on his island, Mechuiti has remained a terror through the ages. Only with the most powerful magic and technology did the ancient humans bind him within the volcanoâ€”the best they could accomplish, since they couldn't destroy him.

**_Maker of the Behtu_**. Mechuiti first enthralled a small band of cannibal pygmies, known as the behtu, by visiting their leaders and priests in dreams and nightmares. After crossbreeding them with carnivorous apes, he infected them with his demonic ichor and taught them tattoo magic to give them fiendish power and strength. The behtu have not found the key to secure their master's release, but they still torture and ensorcel any unlucky explorers who stumble into their abode, hoping to find someone who knows how to unlock their master's prison.
Mechuiti commanded the behtu to breed many fiendish beasts and lizards with his blood: dire apes, fiery giant lizards, and even demonic spiders. He has raised generations of flame dragons, which lair in the volcano's caldera, to guard his temple-fane and deal with any threats beyond the behtu's reach.


**_Demon Lords_**. Demonic powers swarm throughout the lower planes without number. Ancient beasts fade from mortal history, only to reappear eons later when their schemes draw them back to the Material Plane.
**_Mechuiti's Lair_**. Mechuiti is trapped within the volcano in its island prison. Imprisonment hasn't prevented Mechuiti from mustering an army and turning its confinement into a nightmarish bastion.
If Mechuiti is encountered in its lair, it has a challenge rating of 28 (120,000 XP).
