## Description
---
_The rough stone wall reveals a vein of blood-red gemstone running through it._

**_Miners' Menace_**. The ruby ooze has simple tricks, but they work well where humanoids are concerned. Ruby oozes hunt by packing themselves into crevasses in walls and surfaces near areas of high traffic, which has led to many costly battles inside mineshafts.

**_Treasure Stalker_**. Ruby oozes are known to take on a semisolid form that strongly resembles a pile of cut stones. As soon as something warm and moving comes within reach, the ruby ooze lunges with its pseudopods. When confronted with strong and resisting prey, the ruby ooze launches some of its own protoplasm at the creature. This substance hardens the flesh it touches into a ruby-like stone, slowing and harming the creature enough for the ruby ooze to devour what flesh remains. When its prey is immobilized by its acid, the ruby ooze covers the body entirely and dissolves it down to the odd tooth or bit of ruby-colored bone.

**_Hoard Bane_**. The creatures have been employed by those wishing to protect hoards of wealth, but the number of substances the ooze can dissolve makes this an infrequent method of security.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A ruby ooze doesn't require sleep.
