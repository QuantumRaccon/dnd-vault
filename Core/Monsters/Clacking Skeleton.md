## Description
---
_Heard before it is seen, the skeleton approaches, its mismatch of bones from various humanoids clacking and clonking together with each horrid step. Leftover armor hangs from it in pieces and small horns jut half-fused from its skull._

Augmented with necromantic power, the clacking skeleton emits the sound of grinding bone, terrifying those who hear it.

**_Tomb Servitors_**. They are often created as guardians for tombs or the lairs of necromancers from the leftover bones of apprentices, slaves, and scribes. Some believe their clacking is a form of complaint that the creatures must continue to serve their masters even after death.

**_Undead Nature_**. A clacking skeleton doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
