## Description
---
>A mass of disgorged plant material lies at the base of this fleshy tree. Hollowed out areas give the impression of a mouth and a pair of eyes.

**_Disgusting Display_**. At a distance, the fleshdreg's appearance is not quite so disturbing, but a close-up view invokes revulsion in many creatures. Their most unsettling aspect—the constant spewing of plant material—is due to a strange regenerative factor. The trees spontaneously generate plant material, which negatively interacts with their acidic interiors and causes them near-constant digestive discomfort. The fleshdregs can direct this acidified material as a spew, which temporarily suspends this continual production, but they are hesitant to do so except in extreme circumstances. If they lose too much acid or their acid somehow becomes neutralized, the pulpy material fills their innards, bloating them and eventually erupting through their skin.

**_Friendly Trees_**. Many intelligent creatures encountering fleshdregs judge them by their horrifying features, but the fleshdregs are amiable hosts. They understand that many creatures find them repulsive and react to hostility with calming words and a show of peace. Assuming they establish a friendly footing with visitors, they prove to be valuable sources of information about the surrounding territory. In some cases, fleshdregs volunteer to accompany their new acquaintances within a swamp, especially if the fleshdregs seek to relocate.

**_Otherworldly Origins_**. Scholars who have studied the strange trees conclude they derive from some foreign environment. They are split on whether the creatures come from beyond the stars or migrated from deep within the underworld. The scholars agree fleshdregs serve an environmental niche in their native habitat similar to trees and may be an otherworldly equivalent to treants. Fleshdregs assume that they've always existed in their swamps, but they aren't interested enough in their origins to argue with the scholars.
