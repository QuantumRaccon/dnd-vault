## Description

>This upright, muscular boar has short, brown fur. Though it stands on cloven hooves, its arms end in oversized fists.

**_Seeker of Champions_**. The scrofin is a powerfully built creature that seeks to find a worthy challenger for a wrestling challenge. A winner is declared when one creature holds its opponent in a grapple for 30 seconds. The scrofin is aware its natural gifts make it a formidable foe and feels duty-bound to make others aware of its advantages. An honorable battle is its highest goal, and it ensures that no great harm comes to its opponent during the contest, immediately relenting if its opponent submits.

**_Short Tempered_**. If the scrofin feels its opponent is fighting dishonorably or if something unrelated to the wrestling match harms it (a cast spell, a hidden weapon, or similar), it goes berserk at the betrayal. In normal combat situations, it loses its temper when it takes too many injuries. The scrofin can calm itself but only chooses to when it believes its opponents are truly contrite about breaking its trust or harming it.

**_Outcast from the Courts_**. The scrofins' sense of honor is at odds with many of their fellow fey, regardless of court, who believe exploiting any advantage in a situation is acceptable. This coupled with what the fey see as the scrofins' tiresome insistence on proving their physical superiority makes them unwelcome in many fey courts. For their part, scrofins are content to walk the mortal world in search of champions.
