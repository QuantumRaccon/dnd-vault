## Description

> [!INFO] Variant Abilities
>When a beholder's dream-imagination runs wild, the result can be an offspring that has an unusual or unique set of abilities. Rather than the standard powers of a beholder's central eye and eyestalks, the creature has one or more variant abilitiesâ€”guaranteed to surprise any enemies who thought they knew what they were getting themselves into.
>This section provides several alternative spell effects for a beholder's eye. Each of these effects is designed to be of the same power level as the one it replaces, enabling you to create a custom beholder without altering the monster's challenge rating. As another option, you can switch any of the damaging eye rays in the [[Monster Manual]] to an effect with a different damage type, such as replacing the enervation ray with a combustion ray that deals fire damage instead of necrotic damage.
>Unless otherwise indicated, an alternative ability has the same range as the eye ray it is replacing, and it affects only one creature per use (even if the ability is based on a spell that normally affects an area or multiple targets). The saving throw for an alternative ability uses the same DC and the same ability score as the spell the eye ray is based on.
- **Antimagic Cone:**: [[mirage arcane]], [[power word stun]] (affecting the weakest non-[[stunned]] target in the cone each round)
- **Charm Ray:**: [[banishment]] (1 minute), [[confusion]] (1 minute)
- **Death Ray:**: [[circle of death]] (10-foot-radius sphere; 4d6 necrotic damage to all creatures in the area), [[feeblemind]]
- **Disintegration Ray:**: [[chain lightning]] (primary target takes 6d8 lightning damage; two secondary targets within 30 feet of the primary target take 3d8 lightning damage each), [[eyebite]] (sickened effect; 1 minute)
- **Enervation Ray:**: [[create undead]] (usable regardless of the time of day), [[polymorph]] (1 minute)
- **Fear Ray:**: [[gaseous form]] (self or willing creature only), [[moonbeam]]
- **Paralyzing Ray:**: [[modify memory]], [[silence]] (1 minute)
- **Petrification Ray:**: [[Otto's irresistible dance]] (1 minute), [[wall of ice]] (1 minute; one 10-foot-square panel)
- **Sleep Ray:**: [[blindness deafness]], [[misty step]] (self or willing creature only)
- **Slowing Ray:**: [[bestow curse]] (1 minute), [[sleet storm]] (one 10-foot-cube)
- **Telekinesis Ray:**: [[geas]] (1 hour), [[wall of force]] (1 minute; one 10-foot-square panel)
