## Description
---
_The cold white gleam in the glassy eyes of the noble in faded finery burns with evil, and its skin has the ashen pallor of the undead._

Unlike shuffling, mindless specimens of zombie, lord zombies retain their personality and memories. The lord's mind is twisted with jealousy and obsession for the things it left unfinished in life.

**_Corrupted Death_**. A figure of strong will who dies in a place infused with necrotic energy can draw the corruption into itself and rise as a terrifying lord zombie. More tragically, sometimes resurrection magic goes awry, and the victim returns as a nexus of undeath.

**_Spreading Corruption_**. Lord zombies spread a constant wave of necrosis into the world around them. Even long-dead corpses quicken to the lord's call. The creatures are regularly accompanied by legions of zombies and often lair in cemeteries.

**_Undead Nature_**. The lord zombie doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
