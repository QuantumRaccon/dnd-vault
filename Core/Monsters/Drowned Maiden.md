## Description
---
_The drowned maiden is usually found as the corpse of a women floating in the water, her long hair drifting with the current. Occasionally, these are drowned lads rather than maidens, though this is rare._

**_Raging Romantics_**. Drowned maidens are piteous but terrifying undead, created when a woman dies in water due to a doomed romance, whether from unrequited love or whether drowned by a philandering partner. Either way, the drowned maiden awakens from death seeking vengeance. Even as she dishes out retribution, a drowned maiden often anguishes over her doomed existence and tragic fate.

**_Beckoning for Help_**. The maiden lurks in the silent depths where she diedâ€”usually deserted docks, bridges, or coastal cliffs. She waits to pull the living to the same watery grave in which she is now condemned. A drowned maiden uses her [[disguise self]] ability to appear as in life. She silently beckons victims from afar, as if in danger of drowning. When within range, the maiden uses her hair to pull her victim close enough to kiss it. Victims soon weaken and drown. The victim's final vision is the drowned maiden's tearful lament over the loss of life.

**_Death to Betrayers_**. Desperate individuals may bargain with drowned maidens, and they will release pleading victims who promise to return to their lair with the person who caused the maiden's death. Embracing and drowning her betrayer releases the maiden from undeath.
