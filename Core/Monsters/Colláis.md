## Description
---
>The colláis is a large, deer-like creature covered in thick, black fur. A great rack of antlers grows from its thick skull, in which prominent eye sockets display two red embers for eyes. The monster has no mouth; instead, a coarse beard grows in its place.

**_Summoned Protector_**. If a forest village is in danger, the villagers might perform a ritual sacrifice to summon a colláis. Once the ritual is complete, the creature appears in the branches of a nearby tree. It then stalks the village and its surroundings. A colláis returns to its home plane after 24 hours.
