## Description
---
_At first, the strange eyes and gibbering might make the dust goblin seem addled or at least a less-than-formidable foe. But its mastery of command words and bizarre ancient rituals makes these small creatures extremely dangerous, able to call on powers older than human history._

A dust goblin chieftain must keep its tribe alive and fed, which is no small accomplishment in the wastelands it calls home. The chieftain has an edge on its fellows, which helps it keep the others in line, and that edge takes the form of a beneficial mutation brought on by the energies which permeate its homelands.

**_Mastery of Ancient Languages_**. Dust goblin chieftains are often surprisingly learned in ancient tongues, able to speak and command creatures of the outer void, the hells, or from tombs long forgotten. Their ability to decipher scripts and faded text is unmatched.


**_Strange Technology and Oddly Arcane Items_**. Thanks to the ruined civilizations which came before and in whose ruins the dust goblins live, a chieftain has access to a wide variety of unexpected items and magic. The exact nature of these items varies from chieftain to chieftain and is up to the GM's discretion.
