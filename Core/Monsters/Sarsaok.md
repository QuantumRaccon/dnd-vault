## Description
---
>This huge, six-horned, bull-like creature possesses a mane of writhing flames and shimmering metal skin.

**_Creation of the Gods_**. All sarsaok descend from Hadhayosh, a mighty celestial ox said to have been present at the creation of humanity. Scholars speculate the union of domestic or wild oxen with Hadhayosh produced the first sarsaok.

**_Inhospitable Habitats_**. The sarsaok dwell in areas of great heat and fire such as Volcanoes or other geologically active regions. In addition to consuming flora, they are known to drink liquid magma and graze on obsidian, pumice, or other volcanic rock.

**_Peaceful Horror_**. Though of great size and strength, sarsaoks are peaceful herbivores similar in demeanor to wild oxen. When threatened, an entire herd attacks until the threat has ended.
