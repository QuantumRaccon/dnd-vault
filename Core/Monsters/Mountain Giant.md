## Description
---
_The large hill uncurls into a standing position, revealing itself to be an unbelievably large, craggy creature._

**_Children of the Earth_**. At the beginning of time, the first creatures to spring forth were the mountain giants, the daughters and sons of Aurgelmir, first of the giants. Where these gargantuan creatures were born, the mountains themselves heaved up to allow their passage. Since those times, the mountain giants have ruled their places of birth, dwelling atop or within the lofty peaks.


**_Progeny Forged in Fire_**. While not immortal, because even the mountains themselves eventually crumble, the mountain giants are one of the longest-lived creatures known to inhabit the world. Once in its lifetime, whether male or female, a mountain giant feels the call to procreate. It seeks out the nearest active volcano, where it locates a mate with similar yearnings. Their progeny is born soon after, accompanied by spectacular volcanic activity that gives the newborn mountain giant a new home to inhabit and protect.


**_A Giant Among Ants_**. The mountain giant is so large and inscrutable that it considers smaller races as mere insects, pests to be tolerated until they become too much of a nuisance. Then the mountain giant acts, crushing whole towns and villages as a person might step on an anthill. Even the largest stone giants are little more than pets to a mountain giant.


**__**. A mountain giant's lair includes all parts of the mountain that the giant calls home, from the large caverns deep within the mountain to the summit, and everywhere in between. The mountain giant is equally comfortable on the icy, snow-capped peaks as it is in the molten center of a volcano.
The mountain giant patrols its mountain lair regularly, ensuring that no creature is doing any harm, such as mining its metals, minerals, or gems or congregating in large communities in its plateaus, slopes, or valleys. Dwarven clans are the main pests for the mountain giantâ€”they consider these bearded humanoids as humans might consider termites.
