>The foul abomination wriggles about on multiple caterpillar-like claspers. It has the jagged, circular maw and slippery body of an oversized leech and the head and coloration of a fierce tiger.
**_Night Terrors_**. Many sleepers have experienced nightmares in which a shadowy creature was sitting on them, draining them of their vital essence. While most of these experiences are because of some underlying psychological trauma, some are the result of visitations by terrifying creatures of the night. One such creature is the heggarna, a vile aberration that feeds on a creature's mental energy as it sleeps and infuses the victim's subconscious with terrible nightmares for its own vile amusement.

**_Hidden Fear_**. During the day, the heggarna disguises itself as a stray cat, lurking near the homes of potential prey and fleeing with feline-like caution when anyone comes near. Most humanoids overlook simple animals like cats when dealing with a heggarna infestation, but magic can detect the creature's true appearance. Normal animals react to the heggarna with a strange ferocity, which experienced hunters recognize as a sign of a heggarna.
