## Description
---
>A fire-haired woman with ashen skin gently touches a dying tree, igniting it and the surrounding undergrowth.

**_Wardens of Wildfire_**. This beautiful fey with fiery hair and ashen skin wears a cloak of soot as she treads the forests of the world. The ashen custodian cleanses forests with flames, allowing them to grow anew and maintaining the natural cycle of death and rebirth. Though ashen custodians primarily live solitary lives, [[forest drake \|forest drakes]] (Creature Codex) are sometimes found in their company or service. The drakes enjoy acting as intermediaries between a forest's ashen custodian and local druid circles.

**_Life from the Ashes_**. Ashen custodians are born out of the fallen forms of dryads who lost their trees to wildfires. The custodians emerge from the ashes of their charred mothers with new purpose.

**_Double-Edged Fire_**. Ashen custodians set fires to cleanse old growth forests and allow new growth, but they do not revel in forest fires. An ashen custodian is just as likely to prevent a forest fire as she is to set one. The ashen custodian values the role of fire in a forest's life cycle and severely punishes those who start or prevent fires outside of this cycle.
