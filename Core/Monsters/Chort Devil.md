## Description
---
_Small horns crown this pig-faced devil's head. It stands on shaggy goat legs and holds a flaming polearm in its clawed hands. It bears a wicked gleam in its black eyes._

**_Bad Bargains_**. Quick and canny, a chort devil uses varied, pleasing forms to entice mortals to make terrible bargains, but it revels in its obvious devilishness. A chort wants its victim to know it is dealing with a devil. The relative straightforwardness of this approach enables the creature to better deceive those whom it bargains with. After all, the chort affirms, if the victim weren't so desperate, he wouldn't be bargaining with a devil. If necessary, an implied threat of immolation gives it greater bargaining power, but the creature is careful not to torture or otherwise harm its patsy, since that voids any potential contract.

**_Recitation of Contracts_**. An annual spectacle in large cities involves some poor fool who believes he can trick a chort and escape a legal bargain. The devil appears and recites the entirety of the contract its victim signed, replete with embarrassing details about a dispatched rival, the ensnarement of a love who once spurned him, and other disclosures. A chort ensures all those entangled in its victim's affairs are present to hear it, and it disappears once all the victim's dark secrets have been revealed.

**_Smear Tactics_**. A zealous opponent of the chort often finds himself the victim of his own hubris, as the devil digs up or creates vile tales about its foe and brings his folly to light. A chort enjoys tarnishing the reputation of tools of good. For example, it may steal a paladin's sword and use it to murder an especially pious person, leaving the sword in the victim. Thus, a chort dispatches a foe strongly resistant to its manipulations, brings suspicion to another potential foe, and taints a weapon—at least in reputation—which might be used against it.
