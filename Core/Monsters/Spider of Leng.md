## Description
---
_These bloated purple spiders have small claws on their front legs that serve them as handlike manipulators. Their abdomens are a sickly purple-white._

**_Hate Humanoids_**. The nefarious spiders of Leng are highly intelligent. They are a very ancient race, steeped in evil lore and hideous malice, with an abiding hatred for all humanoid races. They sometimes keep [[ghostwalk spider \|ghostwalk spiders]] as guardians or soldiers.

**_Dangerous Blood_**. Their blood is poisonous and corrosive to most creatures native to the Material Plane. The folk of Leng prize it in the making of etheric harpoons and enchanted nets.
