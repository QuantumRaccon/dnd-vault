## Description
---
_The ghouls create horrific, intelligent, undead mounts for their most worthy soldiers and priests._

Although they're large, run on all fours, and can be ridden as mounts, ghoulsteeds are the undead remains of humanoids. They're created when a humanoid is killed by massive amounts of necrotic energy.

**_Hideous Mounts_**. Darakhul prize these undead creatures as mounts. They're ridden during war and hunts, but they are sometimes also trained as guardians for households, businesses, or temples.


**_Often Mute_**. Ghoulsteeds aren't quite as intelligent as ghouls, but they're cannier than most creatures give them credit for being. Certainly, unlike most creatures used as mounts, they are somewhat intelligent and capable of speech, but they prefer to remain mute as much as possible to avoid drawing attention to themselves. This makes them useful as gossips, spies, and informers among the darakhul, who have a tendency to forget their mounts' intelligences.


**_Prone to Biting_**. Ghoulsteeds are notorious for nibbling, nipping, or outright biting their riders, creatures passing by them, or the like.


**_Undead Nature_**. The ghoulsteed doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
