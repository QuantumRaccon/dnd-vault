## Description
---
Kobolds come in many shapes and sizes, many of which have been detailed in other publications. There are a few kobold groups, however, that seem to have flown under the radar of those who study their culture and habitat. The following is a detailed study of five such groups within the kobold society.

**_Kobold Air Cavalry_**. Kobold's adoration of dragons is as ancient as the origin of Kurtulmak, and kobolds are known to provide service, and worship, to dragon kind. Occasionally a dragon may see fit to reward a tribe of kobolds with a momentous boonâ€”a clutch of kobold/ dragon hybrid eggs. Strong and agile winged kobolds with breath weapons are the result.
