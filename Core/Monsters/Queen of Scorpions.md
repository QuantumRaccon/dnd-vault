## Description
---
>The unearthly beauty of this woman is marred by her sinister eyes and the large scorpion tail rising up behind her head.

**_Exiled Lord_**. Known as Chelamma by the nearby locals, the Queen of Scorpions was once a powerful member of the animal lords, until her appetites for blood and murder led to her exile. This punishment is an affront to her pride, and she plots revenge against the other animal lords and anyone they hold dear.

**_Mistress of Poison_**. The Queen of Scorpions resides in an ancient desert temple carved in the side of a stone cliff. The temple is a complex network of canyons filled with scorpions, spiders, and shrouded cultists. Assassin's guilds, thieves' dens, and other underworld organizations rely on the Queen of Scorpions for the deadliest poisons and most potent acids. She operates her shipments of poisons via her shrouded cultists and a network of go-betweens. Only a select few of her customers are aware of the true identity of their supplier.

**_Murderer of Monarchs_**. The long exile imposed on the Queen of Scorpions turned her lust for murder into a dangerous addiction. She delights in seducing nobles, kings, and queens with promises of power or magic and slowly poisoning them to watch her prey wither to death. Her delight often gets the better of her as she lingers over a dying person just a little too long, leaving her dangerously close to being caught. The other animal lords believe it is only a matter of time before her luck runs out.


**_Animal Lords_**. While humanoids have vast pantheons and divine figures of every stripe, the animals of the world have much simpler forms of faith. Among each species there is always one paragon that embodies the animal spirit in a humanoid form, the better to speak to others and represent the animals in celestial councils.
The animal lords first appear in the Creature Codex. Two additional animal lords are presented here: the Queen of Scorpions, an exiled animal lord who manipulates the mortal world through a complex network of thieves and spies from her desert home, and the Toad King, a burgeoning animal lord who seeks apotheosis by sending brave heroes on complex quests.
