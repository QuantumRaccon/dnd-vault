## Description
---
>A monstrous woman with claws and hooves of shining copper, the creature stalks the roads and tracks between towns, seeking to kill and devour any who stumble across her path.

**_Bane of Travelers_**. Distant kin to lamias, the dreadful empusae are exclusively female. They use their supernatural abilities to hunt down and devour the flesh of those traveling along deserted roads and byways between settlements. While empusae aren't afraid of sunlight, they tend to hunt at night, returning to caves and ruins during the day to feast on those they have killed. When travelers aren't available, empusae target shepherds and farmers, disguising themselves as goats or donkeys to get close to their targets.

**_Copper Hooves_**. The legs and hooves of an empusa are extremely powerful and are sheathed in magically-hardened copper, allowing her to deliver swift and powerful kicks and move at great speed. This copper can be harvested when the empusa is slain and is often used in the construction of magical boots and staffs.


> [!INFO] Empusae in Midgard
>Many in Midgard believe empusae to be the servants or even daughters of Hecate, though this notion is soundly refuted by her church and her followers. What can't be denied is that empusae are more commonly encountered in areas where the worship of Hecate is strong and in the wilds between the Seven Cities, particularly the roads linking Kammae with the other cities of the region. The empusae themselves are silent on the matter, but small shrines to Hecate have been found in some empusa lairs.
