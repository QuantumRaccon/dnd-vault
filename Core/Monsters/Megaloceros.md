## Description
---
Megaloceroses are living ancestors to smaller deer and elks that roam cold forests. It is an avid protector of the animals in its forest, often coming to their rescue. A megaloceros is also sympathetic to those who get lost in its woods or seem to struggle with survival in the cold. The creature beckons unfortunate travelers to follow it to safety, often just outside a village it knows to be friendly. If a visitor to a forest overseen by a megaloceros has a peaceful encounter with the creature, the megaloceros might later come to that visitor's aid, protecting it from predatory animals or rescuing it from some natural hazard.
