## Description
---
_An enraged mass of malcontents storms across the tavern, overturning tables, busting bottles, and browbeating innocent patrons._

**_A Convergence of Felines_**. Seeing a group of cats (called a clowder) slinking down an alley barely registers in the minds of busy city-dwellers. Pests to some, pets to others, and invisible to most, the domestic housecat does not seem much of a threat. However, any beast with tooth and claw poses a threat on some level. And hundreds of those beasts, inspired and working together, can be a terrifying prospect.


**_The Cats and the Weather_**. The first sign a victim of the cats of Ulthar sees is cloudy, violent weather. The bluest, clearest daytime skies or the finest moonlit nights become stormy nightmares when the cats of Ulthar are on the prowl.


**_A Hissing, Seething Mass_**. Through the darkness provided by the suddenly darkened skies, the cats of Ulthar come together, some from their comfortable homes and others from their wild dens. The call spares no feline, and all types of cats join together to form the swarm. The victims often do not see the cats until it is too late. The only thing the victims notice is a single hiss that rises up from the mass of fur and death.
