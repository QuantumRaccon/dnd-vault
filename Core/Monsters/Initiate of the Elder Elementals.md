## Description
---
>The kobold stands at the stone altar, chanting words of elemental power. Winds swirl around it, the stone beneath its feet rumbles, and fire ignites in one hand while frost rimes the other.

**_Elemental Servant_**. Serving as part of a secret cabal, the initiate taps into the elemental magic that taints it to serve the four great elemental lords of evil. It often worships in secret underground sites devoted to its dark gods. Service means access to power, and an initiate hopes to use that power to rise in station.
