## Description

>Strutting forward on four legs tipped with sharp talons, this raptor-like fiend has dark crimson feathers covering its scaled hide and an extended, eyeless, saw-toothed maw. A baleful orange eye glares from the monster's chest.

**_Primeval Devils_**. Tzepharions are perhaps the most savage and primal of all devils. They care little for the schemes and temptations of other devils and are happy to spend their time chasing and devouring lower life forms. For this reason, tzepharions are treated as simple beasts by other fiends, and packs of tzepharions are sometimes employed by pit fiends and arch-devils on hunting trips.

**_Structured Packs_**. Despite their limited intelligence, tzepharions are highly lawful fiends and organize themselves into tightly regimented packs to hunt down prey. Each tzepharion knows its place in the pack and coordinates with its fellows in battle. Tzepharions on the Material Plane band together for survival or work to control a pack of [[dire wolf \|dire wolves]], a pride of [[lion \|lions]], or another group of carnivorous beasts.
