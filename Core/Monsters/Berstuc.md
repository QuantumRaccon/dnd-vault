## Description
---
_Although slightly stooped, this male figure is muscular and broadshouldered. The creature's head is lost in a riot of moss, and a thick mustache and beard reach almost to its waist._

The hulking, moss-haired berstuc looks sculpted out of a primordial forestâ€”and it stands over 12 feet tall and weighs 800 pounds. Despite its great stature, it seems strangely gentle, with a serene, almost soothing presence. Nothing could be further from the truth; the berstuc is a murderous demon that stalks woodlands and jungles of the Material Plane.

**_Poisoned Fruit_**. Berstuc prowl forests in search of travelers to torment. A berstuc demon poses as a benevolent, or at least indifferent, wood spirit to gain the trust of mortals. It allows itself to be persuaded to help lost travelers (reluctantly) or to lead them to their destinations. Once it draws its unwitting prey deep into the woods, it strikes.

**_Verdant Nature_**. The berstuc doesn't require food or sleep.
