## Description
---
>A creature with two legs and a flat tail emerges from the water. Its wide mouth opens, revealing a spiked tongue.

**_Luring with Thirst_**. The vallowex haunts woodland rivers, luring in prey with its thirst-inducing aura. When a creature stops to drink, the vallowex attacks and drags the creature into the water to feast.

**_Reproduce through Hosts_**. Vallowexes release eggs into potable water. After a creature drinks the eggs, a tadpole hatches in its stomach. The tadpole slowly consumes the host from the inside out, emerging as a vallowex when the host dies.
