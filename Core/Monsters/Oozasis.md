## Description
---
_The oasis appears as an idyllic desert respite, offering water, shade, and even perhaps edible fruit and nuts in the trees above._

**_Mockmire_**. The oozasis, or oasis ooze, is also known as a mockmire in other climates. It mimics a peaceful, pristine watering hole to draw in unsuspecting prey. An oozasis cycles seemingly at random between wakefulness and hibernation.

**_Quest Givers_**. Within its odd physiology stirs an ancient mind with an inscrutable purpose. Far from being a mere mindless sludge, its fractured intelligence occasionally awakens to read the thoughts of visitors. At these times, it tries to coerce them into undertaking quests for cryptic reasons.

**_Ancient Minds_**. Some tales claim these creatures preserve the memories of mad wizards from dead empires, or that they have unimaginably ancient, inhuman origins.
