## Description
---
_This mote of electrical energy floats menacingly, erupting in a shower of sparks and tendrils of lightning. When it disappears, it leaves only the whiff of ozone._

**_Born in Storms_**. When a great storm rips across a world in the Material Plane, it sometimes tears loose the fabric of reality, releasing sentient creatures composed entirely of elemental energy. Fueled by its frenetic thought patterns and erratic actions, a spark jolts through its new world to find a physical body, drawn by an urge to know form.

**_Symbionts and Twins_**. Some spellcasters deliberately seek out sparks for symbiosis. Sorcerers or clerics devoted to deities of the elements may reach an agreement with these creatures, allowing them to ride within their bodies for their entire lifetime.
Occasionally when a spark forms, an oppositely charged mate is created at the same time. When this happens, the two always stay within 300 feet of one another. Sparks rarely survive longer than a year, even within a symbiotic relationship with a mortal form. When they expire, they simply wink out and return to the elemental planes.

**_Seek Strong Hosts_**. When a formless spark senses a potential body approaching, it dims its light or enters a metallic object. Sparks prefer to inhabit creatures with high Strength over other possible targets. Once in control of a body, the spark uses the new vessel to deliver shocking grasp attacks or to cast lightning bolt or call lightning against distant enemies. If ejected from a creature, a spark immediately tries to inhabit another.
