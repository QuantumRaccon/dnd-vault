## Description
---
_This mole-like creature is the size of a large dog, with a thick, barrel-shaped body as heavy as a full-grown dwarf. A ring of tentacles sprouts above a mouth dominated by spade-like incisors. It has no visible ears and only tiny, cataract-filled eyes, but somehow it senses its environment nonetheless._

**_Domesticated by Dwarves_**. Mountain dwarves have domesticated many subterranean creatures, among them a breed of giant talpidae commonly called dogmoles. Energetic and obedient, dogmoles pull ore-trolleys through mines, sniff out toxic gases and polluted waters, and help dig out trapped miners.

**_Sense Cave-Ins_**. Dogmoles are renowned for their ability to detect imminent cave-ins and burrowing monsters, making them welcome companions in the depths. Outside the mines, dogmoles serve as pack animals, guard beasts, and bloodhounds.

**_Derro Cruelty_**. Derro also use dogmoles, but such unfortunate creatures are scarred and brutalized, barely controllable even by their handlers.
