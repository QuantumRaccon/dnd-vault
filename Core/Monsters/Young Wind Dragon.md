## Description
---
_Howling wind encircles the white- and gray-scaled dragon, filling and pushing its wings without the need for them to beat._

Wind dragons view anywhere touched by air as their property, and mortals point to them as the epitome of arrogance. Their narcissism is not without reason, for awe-inspiring power supports their claims of rightful control. To the dragons of the shifting gales, strength is the ultimate arbiter. Although wind dragon wyrmlings are the weakest of the newborn dragons, they grow in power rapidly, and few fully-grown dragons are seen as stronger.

**_Braggarts and Bullies_**. Wind dragons number among the greatest bullies and worst tyrants among mortal creatures. The sometimes foolhardy creatures take personal offense at any perceived challenge and great pleasure in humiliating rivals. They claim great swathes of territory but care little for its governance, and they perceive the mortals in that territory as possessions. Vassals receive only dubious protection in exchange for unflinching loyalty. A wind dragon might seek bloody vengeance for the murder of a follower, but it's unlikely to go to any length to prevent the loss of life in the first place.

**_Lords of the Far Horizons_**. Some believe that the dragons of the winds claim much more than they are capable of controlling or patrolling. Because they so love altitude, they prefer to rule and meet with earth-bound supplicants at the highest point available: the summit of a great mountain or atop a towering monument erected by fearful slaves. But these dragons are also driven by wanderlust, and often travel far from their thrones. They always return eventually, ready to subjugate new generations and to press a tyrannical claw on the neck of anyone who questions their right to rule.

**_Perpetual Infighting_**. These wandering tyrants are even more territorial among their own kind than they are among groundlings. Simple trespass by one wind dragon into the territory of another can lead to a battle to the death. Thus their numbers never grow large, and the weakest among them are frequently culled.
Wind dragons' hoards typically consist of only a few truly valuable relics. Other dragons might sleep on a bed of coins, but common things bore wind dragons quickly. While all true dragons desire and display great wealth, wind dragons concentrate their riches in a smaller number of notable trophies or unique historic itemsâ€”often quite portable.

> [!INFO] Wind Dragon Tactics
>Wind dragons much prefer to fight from the air, and can be effective with spells and breath weapons there. However, this can be quite frustrating for parties without ranged attacks, and even then, ancient dragons are immune to non-magical ranged attacks and adult wind dragons impose disadvantage. Just as importantly, the wind dragon's own legendary actions and its multiattack both require being closer and in melee. Wind dragons are designed to soften up foes at range, and then swoop in for the kill in melee, carrying off one or more victims.


**_Wind Dragon's Lair_**. Wind dragons make their lairs in locations where they can overlook and dominate the land they claim as theirs, but remote enough so the inhabitants can't pester them with requests for protection or justice. They have little to fear from the elements, so a shallow cave high up on an exposed mountain face is ideal. Wind dragons enjoy heights dotted with rock spires and tall, sheer cliffs where the dragon can perch in the howling wind and catch staggering updrafts and downdrafts sweeping through the canyons and tearing across the crags. Non-flying creatures find these locations much less hospitable.
