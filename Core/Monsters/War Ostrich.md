## Description
---
In the wild, war ostriches are dangerous and skittish beasts, prone to lashing out with punishing kicks while sprinting around the battlefield. The n'kosi use them to create chaos among their foes, by driving a flock of fast-moving war ostriches into a caravan or into enemy troop formations.

**_Faster than Horses_**. War ostriches have been domesticated for centuries, and they are a fearsome sight on the field of combat when bearing warriors into battle. War ostriches are heavily employed in regions where horses are rare or impractical or where their incredible leaping ability enables cavalry to charge over broken ground.
