## Description
---
_These small, vicious fey look like dirty, lazy dwarves dressed in burlap pants and shirts tied on with dirty twine and frayed rope. They are usually bootless with broken, dirty toenails and wearing rough burlap and leather tams as hats._

**_Corrupted Dwarves_**. Nicknamed "vanishers," these small, vicious, dwarf-like fey haunt abandoned quarries and ancient ruins, killing and robbing unsuspecting visitors. Legend says the scheznykis are lazy dwarves corrupted by the shadow fey, though others claim that these are dwarves who swore allegiance to fey lords and ladies long ago. They live in drowned and abandoned mines, tumbledown ruins, and even in the tomb complexes of long.departed priests and god-kings.

**_Magical Hats_**. Their shadow fey masters have given them magical hats that allow them to fly and become invisible at will. These hats can be stolen and used by adventurers (see sidebar), but the scheznykis fight hard to retrieve them.

**_Arcane Beards_**. If an adventurer can successfully grapple a scheznyki, they can attempt to cut the creature's beard with a magical blade (the beard is AC 15 and has 5 hp). When an attacker successfully cuts off the beard, the scheznyki loses access to all spell-like and spell casting abilitiesâ€”and the beard hair itself is valuable in making potion inks.
If the scheznyki loses its hat and beard at the same time, it falls into a deep, wasting coma and dies in 24 hours or when next exposed to sunlight. When this occurs, the scheznyki's body crumbles into dust and blows away one round later. If its beard is magically mended or regrown, or its hat restored to its head before this happens, the scheznyki recovers fully and immediately.
