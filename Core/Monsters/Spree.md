## Description
---
_This wild gnome's shaggy hair is matted on one side with blood. It has razorlike claws, and its teeth are filed to points._

Gnomes who die while succumbing to vile, homicidal desires sometimes return as murderous, demonic creatures.

**_Instigators of Madness_**. Spree demons have a similar appearance to gnomes, but they look even more deranged. They seek to infect others with their murderous desires and inflict curses on those they harm. A single spree demon can incite violence that cripples a city for weeks, but they prefer to group up to spread mayhem all the quicker.
