## Description

>Gnarled roots reaching deep into the muck act as legs for this group of trees conjoined into a sentient being.

**_Ancient Grove Guardians_**. Mangrove treants provide shelter and a resource-rich environment for many creatures. They extend their roots into the water, where several species of fish thrive. Biting and stinging insects, most notably mosquitos, dart about in cloud-like formations near the water's surface. Arboreal animals nest high among the treants' boughs mostly removed from the depredations of the insects. Unlike their forest cousins, these swampland treants are more concerned with the safety of those under their protection and less concerned with the overall health of the swamp. They decisively react to direct threats to themselves and the creatures within their boughs and roots, but they may not act if something endangers an area outside their immediate groves.
Mangrove treants continue to grow throughout their extraordinarily long lives, which can reach millennia if they see no external disruptions. The treants also add ordinary mangrove trees into their gestalt, incorporating the trees' ecosystems into its whole.

**_Friend to Lizardfolk_**. While a mangrove treant is generally wary of civilization, it befriends lizardfolk who show proper deference. Lizardfolk help control the treant's fish population, since the treant normally doesn't house predators, and they act as protectors to the treant. Various groups of lizardfolk venerate a mangrove treant as a respected elder or a being sacred to their deities. Some lizardfolk shamans know the secret to awakening a mangrove treant.

**_Mosquito Whisperer_**. A mangrove treant eventually learns to communicate with all the creatures inhabiting its grove, but it can always communicate with mosquitos. A dormant mangrove treant that is hosting mosquitos is rarely caught off guard thanks to diligent reporting from the insects. The treant can send mosquitos on reconnaissance missions, but the insects provide increasingly vague details the farther they travel from the treant, making them reliable spies only over short distances.
The treant also has a modicum of control over mosquitos. It typically exerts its will to keep the insects from overwhelming the animals living among its branches. When the treant faces a threat, though, it can call the mosquitos into a swarm to drive off or kill the threat.
