## Description
---
_This humanoid wasp's gossamer wings beat out a soft, droning buzz. Flashing blades sing in each of her four clawed hands, and the air around her crackles with arcane energy._

**_Center of the Hive_**. The hive-queen is the nerve center of a tosculi hive-city, simultaneously one of a hive's greatest strengths and weaknesses. The hive-queen serves as a unifying force. She binds her swarm with an ironclad sense of purpose through the hive mind, the psychic web that links all tosculi within a hive.

**_Deadly Inheritance_**. A hive-queen typically has several immature daughters as her potential heirs at any given time. When she nears the end of her life, the hive-queen selects the most promising of her heirs and feeds her a special concoction. This speeds the heir's maturation and makes her ready to become a full-fledged hive-queen. The daughter's first action upon assuming power and control over the hive-city is to devour her mother and all her sisters.

**_Hive Chaos_**. If a hive-queen dies with no heir to anchor the hive mind, the city plunges into chaos. Tosculi bereft of the hivemind go berserk. A few fortunate ones might escape and become lone renegades, but their existence without the comforting presence of the hive is miserable and short. Unless one of the hive-queen's daughters is mature enough and ruthless enough to step in and assert control, the hive is doomed.


**_A Tosculi Hive-Queen's Lair_**. Hive-queens make their lairs in the most protected part of the hive. Huge corridors lead to this point, so all tosculi can reach their queen as quickly as possible. This is also the place where tosculi eggs hatch, making it a critical location for the survival of the hive. A tosculi hive-queen encountered in her lair has a challenge rating of 13 (10,000 XP).
