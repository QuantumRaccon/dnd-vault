## Description
---
Of all the demons lurking in the Abyss, few are as vile and disgusting as Akyishigal, the lord of cockroaches. His filth-slicked mandibles clack ceaselessly for the flesh and souls of humanoids.

**_Civilization's Corruption_**. Although Akyishigal has sired an entire race in his image, he craves followers among humans, elves, and other races as a means of corrupting civilization, rotting it from within. Despite his repulsiveness, Akyishigal has followers among the urban dispossessed, the slum-dwelling poor, and those who lurk in lightless undercities. His shrines are tended in abandoned houses, tanneries and butcher yards, as well as in sewers and similar places.

**_Filth Sacrifices_**. In these shrines, kidnapped victims find themselves submerged in filth up to their necks. While the demon lord's cultists chant, sacramental roaches feast on the prisoner's eyes and tongue. A victim who survives the rite is dumped back onto the streets.

**_Persistent Cults_**. Akyishigal's cults are almost as difficult to stamp out as real cockroach infestations. No matter how they are driven off or crushed, followers resurface among the teeming mobs of the downtrodden. Typical worshipers include evil humanoids, particularly kobolds and goblins as well as roachlings, minor demons, slaves, thralls, and shadow creatures of all stripes.


**_Demon Lords_**. Demonic powers swarm throughout the lower planes without number. Ancient beasts fade from mortal history, only to reappear eons later when their schemes draw them back to the Material Plane.
