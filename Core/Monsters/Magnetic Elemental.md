## Description
---
>The large, smooth rock stands, the air around it humming with energy. As it walks, nearby daggers, lanterns, and buckled boots move to follow it.

Magnetic elementals spontaneously appear where the Plane of Earth meets the Plane of Air. They are magnetized, rocky creatures capable of switching their polarity to repel attacks and pull enemies closer.
**_Smooth Stone_**. Magnetic elementals are worn smooth by the elemental air that creates them. They are able to harness this air to fly, and, when on the Material Plane, they occupy areas where vast swaths of stone are exposed to the sky, such as mountain peaks and deep canyons.

**_Iron Summons_**. Spellcasters who want to conjure a magnetic elemental must mix iron shavings into the soft clay. Such spellcasters must take caution, however, as the elementals often inadvertently attract the armor and weapons of those nearby.

**_Elemental Nature_**. The magnetic elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
