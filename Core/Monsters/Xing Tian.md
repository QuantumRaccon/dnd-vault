## Description
---
>This headless brute has two eyes in its chest and a mouth in its belly.

**_Descendants of a Fallen God_**. All xing tian descend from a god of the same name who challenged the eldest deities and lost. As punishment, his head was removed, but he simply grew eyes and a mouth on his chest and continued to fight.

**_Fearless Warriors_**. The xing tian, known by locals as "headless giants," live on the fringes of civilization, occasionally raiding settlements for plunder and loot. They dwell in small, isolated villages where leadership roles go to the individuals who can withstand the most pain. The most powerful xing tian wear their hideous scars with pride.

**_Symbol of Perseverance_**. The xing tian's fortitude and regenerative properties lead many to consider them a symbol of an indomitable will and the drive to continue no matter the hardships.
