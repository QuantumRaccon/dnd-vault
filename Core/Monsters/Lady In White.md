## Description
---
_Swathed in white robes, skirts, and scarves, a lady in white seems to be a living woman for a time—until she reveals her true face, often one that terrifies all who see it._

**_Tragic Apparitions_**. The spirit of a woman who met a terrible, tragic end, often through murder at the hands of loved ones, a lady in white wanders near the place where she died.

**_Unpredictable Encounters_**. Encounters with ladies in white vary markedly. The only consistent details are the general appearance of the ladies—that they seem to be living women when first encountered—and the fact that they rarely appear in front of more than a few people at once. Though the ladies in white often appear confused or lost, some do so to deceive and lead people into danger. Some will change their appearance suddenly, revealing the injuries from which they died and frightening people into the path of some hazard.

**_Signs of the Past_**. Some ladies in white do no more than ask for directions or an escort home, disappearing along the route. Their sudden departure is usually accompanied by a scream at the location where their lives came to an end, but they otherwise cause their escorts no harm. The most frightening and wellknown encounters with ladies in white are when their appearances reveal the ones who killed them.

**_Undead Nature_**. lady in white doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
