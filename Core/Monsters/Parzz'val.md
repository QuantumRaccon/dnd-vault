## Description
---
>Six legs, ending in massive, three-fingered humanoid hands, support a headless horse-like torso. The front of this creature's mass opens into a huge tripartite maw filled with jagged, web-shrouded ridges dripping a caustic substance.

**_Bottomless Hunger_**. Parzz'vals have enough intelligence to reason and problem solve, but they are largely guided by their monstrous appetites. Parzz'vals prefer live prey but are not above eating carrion if their preferred meal isn't available.

**_Ambush Hunters_**. Despite their enormous hunger, parzz'vals are excellent at taking their prey by surprise. A parzz'val can wait patiently for hours for the ideal time to strike if they anticipate a meal awaits as a reward.


> [!INFO] Parzz'vals in Midgard
>Parzz'vals are created by the treacherous wizard Enkada Pishtuhk in his efforts to recreate a controllable, loyal version of Pah'draguusthlai the Devourer. Thus far, his attempts have failed. No matter what form his creations take at their birth, they twist into an uncontrollable parzz'val over the course of a week or less. He releases each of these failed creations out into the Wasted West to wreak havoc.
