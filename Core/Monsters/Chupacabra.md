## Description
---
_This fearsome creature stands about three feet tall and looks like a cross between a dog and a reptile. Its body is covered in a leathery greenish-gray hide, and a crest of spines runs down its back. A pair of bulging, glowing eyes stare intently as it opens its mouth, revealing a set of razor sharp fangs._

Chupacabras wander remote hills and plains at night, alone or in small packs, in search of their prey. They will sometimes attack lone humans, but they prefer to feed on the blood of sheep and other domestic animals. Goats are a particular favorite.

**_Stealthy Hunters_**. The chupacabra stalks its quarry before leaping out and sinking its teeth into the creature's neck to drain its blood. When hunting in open ground, the chupacabra will use its terrible glowing eyes to paralyze its victim with fear before attacking. Creatures killed by chupacabra are found completely drained of blood with a triangular, almost bat-shaped, puncture wound in their necks. Superstitious farmers may blame vampires, but those brave enough, and who know of the chupacabra, may band together to hunt down the true culprit, using a caged goat as bait.


**_Servants of the Demon Bat_**. Chupacabras are sometimes bred underground by derro worshippers of [[Camazotz, Demon Lord of Bats and Fire \|Camazotz]], the Demon Lord of Bats (Tome of Beasts). The sudden appearance of the creatures in a locality may indicate the presence of Demon Bat cultists below ground. Worse, whispered rumors tell of chupacabras with bat-like wings created by the derro savants under direction from their dreaded [[Mi-Go]] allies.
