## Description
---
>The herald of the void portends the world's ruination by means of cold, fire, plague, war, or a magical apocalypse of another kind. It speaks only in the voice of disasters, and it empowers, goads, and encourages the followers of every unspeakable god and the leaders of every profane death cult.

**_Empty Whispers_**. In the days before a herald of the Void visits a territory, ghostly occurrences become more common, especially at night. Strange, luminous forms are seen under rafts, among the trees, and in any dark and empty place.

**_Creature of Motion_**. The herald of the Void always seems stirred by a breeze, even in an airless space. Nothing short of stopping time itself can change this.

**_Folding Infinite Space_**. While the herald of the Void seems corporeal, its body displays a strange ability to fold itself in impossible ways, and sometimes it seems to teleport great distances or to summon objects from afar without effort.
