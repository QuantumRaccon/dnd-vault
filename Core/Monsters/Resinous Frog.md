## Description
---
Resinous frogs secrete a fluid from their skin and tongues that adheres to most material, even if the frogs are in water. Most creatures stuck to the frogs become exhausted in the struggle to break free, providing the patient frog a later meal. If the frog has a dangerous predator stuck to its tongue, it can detach its tongue and leave the predator behind while it escapes. The frogs' limited regenerative capabilities allow them to regrow lost tongues.

> [!INFO] Resinous Frog Resin
>The adhesive material produced by a resinous frog remains viable for 24 hours after it is removed from the frog. A resinous frog produces one ounce of collectible resin each day or four ounces if slain. One ounce of resin can cover a 1-foot square surface and creates a bond between any two objects. A successful DC 13 Strength check breaks the bond, freeing the objects from each other.
