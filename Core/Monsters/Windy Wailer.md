**_Spirits of Violence_**. When sailors meet a violent end at sea within sight of the shore and leave no bodies behind to be buried, they sometimes arise as terrible undead known as windy wailers. Caught eternally in the last moments that took its life, the windy wailer seeks to spread its misery to others, raising the elements to overturn ships and drown sailors.

**_Found in Storms_**. Windy wailers are normally encountered in the midst of a great storm or other turbulent weather where they can hide amid the wind and rain before launching their attacks. They often strike when a group of sailors are at their most vulnerable, such as when the ship is close to rocks, the rigging has been damaged, or someone has been knocked overboard.

**_Unusual Allies_**. Aquatic undead, [[will-o'-wisp \|will-o'-wisps]], and [[wraith \|wraiths]] are all drawn to the windy wailer's unnatural power, aiding the creature in its malefic activities or feeding in its wake.

**_Undead Nature_**. A windy wailer doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
