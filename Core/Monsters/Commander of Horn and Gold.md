## Description
---
>An imposing figure clad in black plate armor chased with gold embellishment steps out of the shadows, flourishing a claw-tipped black spear.

Kaedrin Blackwing cuts a striking image in his gold and black armor, adorned with the horns, teeth, and claws of elder shadow drakes. He is a tall, purple-skinned fey with a pair of curling ram's horns, and he moves with military precision. His voice is hollow, and his expression borders on cruel at the calmest of moments.
He is the Commander of Horn and Gold, and he oversees a watchtower that perches on a black mountain crag in the Plane of Shadow, where thick gray ashes drift from the leaden sky like grimy snow. The Tower of Horn and Gold is inhabited by a cadre of shadow fey knights and a contingent of goblin retainers and miners.
**_Master of Drakes_**. A network of lightless tunnels and caverns inhabited by a host of [[elder shadow drake \|shadow drakes]] (Tome of Beasts) fills the black mountain beneath the tower. The commander and his knights have forged an alliance with the drakes, exchanging access to the tunnels—and the drakes' service as fearsome mounts—for protection, food, and treasure.

**_Guardian of Wealth and Power_**. Besides the power the shadow drakes themselves represent, the tunnels beneath the tower brim with riches. Veins of shadow gold run through the rock, and the goblins and shadow fey diligently mine the precious substance.

> [!INFO] The Commander in Midgard
>The Tower of Horn and Gold stands atop the Mistcall Mountains in the Shadow Realm, to the relative west of the Courts of the Shadow Fey. The commander holds this western border and defends the shadow gold mines, as well as a shadow road and powerful ley line nexus deep in the drake caverns.
>Shadow gold resembles standard gold, but it is infused with the essence of the Shadow Ream. When the metal is molten, scratched, or bent, the damage to the metal is pitch black, revealing its true nature. Shadow fey mint coins and other trinkets from shadow gold, and shower it liberally upon mortals, buying their services, loyalty, and some say enslaving their souls, one coin at a time.
>For more information on the shadow fey, see the _Midgard Worldbook_.

> [!INFO] Touch of Iron
>Lords and ladies of the fey courts are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats. A universal exception to this is weapons of [[cold iron weapon \|cold-wrought iron]]. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh. A cold iron weapon is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies. However, cold iron weapons are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficult—and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.


**_The Commander's Lair_**. The commander's lair is the Tower of Horn and Gold in the Plane of Shadow, as well as the dark mountain ridge on which the tower sits and the shadow drake tunnels in the rock beneath the tower.
When encountered in his lair, the commander has a challenge rating of 16 (15,000 XP).
