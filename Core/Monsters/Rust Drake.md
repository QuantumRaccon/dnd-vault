## Description
---
_A motionless rust drake is easily mistaken for a pile of scrap metal._

**_Shedding Rust_**. Aside from fangs and claws like iron spikes, this dragon-like creature seems to be nothing more than a collection of rust. Each beating of its wings brings a shower of flakes.

**_Warped Metallics_**. Many sages claim that rust dragons are a perversion of nature's order obtained either by the corruption of a metallic dragon's egg or the transformation of such a dragon by way of a ritual. Others disagree and propose another theory about a malady that affects the skin of young metallic dragons and ferrous drakes alike. So far, no one has discovered the truth about their origins.

**_Filthy Scrap Metal Eaters_**. These foul creatures feed on rust and are known as disease carriers.
