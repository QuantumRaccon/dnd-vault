## Description
---
>This skeleton's bones are crystal and caked with layers of frost and ice.

**_Origin_**. Glacial corrupters are similar in nature to most [[skeleton \|skeletons]], except their bones have been transformed into crystal by the dark magic that created them. Cold has permeated their forms to such an extent that they exude an unnatural cold that cannot be warmed. They come about in one of two ways: when a creature is killed by a glacial corrupter or when a creature is killed by a [[sapphire jelly]].

**_Limited Intelligence_**. Glacial corrupters are much like basic skeletons in that they are not truly self-aware. They are undead who either follow the simple instructions of necromancers or other creatures that can control them, or they follow a basic drive to destroy any living creatures they encounter. They are often used as guardians who do not tire, or as part of an attacking force for a greater power. They have no memories of their previous lives.

**_Undead Nature_**. A glacial corrupter doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
