## Description
---
>This towering ogre is covered in rippling muscles. It wears a suit of burnished scale mail and hefts a gleaming greatsword in its hands. A large white horn emerges from the ogre's forehead, glowing with a strange blue radiance.

**_Ogre Royalty_**. A one-horned ogre is not only physically more impressive than other ogres, it also radiates a terrible majesty that causes most other ogres to supplicate themselves before it. Even creatures like [[tusked crimson ogre \|crimson-tusked ogres]] (Creature Codex), [[ettin \|ettins]], and [[hill giant \|hill giants]] find themselves bowing to these creatures and following them into battle. As a result, most one-horned ogres are the leaders of tribes or families of ogres. Though one-horned ogres are generally at the top of the political pyramid, they sometimes serve an even greater power, such as a coven of hags, an ogre mage, or a red dragon.

**_Dark Gifts_**. One-horned ogres gain their power through a dark pact with a fiend. This pact manifests in the shape of a horn that grows from their brow, which grants them great power but also makes them vulnerable. Their horns come in black, crimson, and white, depending on the type of fiend the ogre serves. Black-horned ogres serve demons and other chaotic fiends, white-horned ogres serve neutral fiends, and crimson-horned ogres serve devils and other lawful fiends. If a one-horned ogre ever loses its horn, its allies either flee or turn on their former leader, often resulting in its death. As a result, one-horned ogres are paranoid about their horns and sometimes go to excessive lengths to cover or protect their horns in battle.
