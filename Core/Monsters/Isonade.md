## Description
---
_The isonade's gargantuan thrashing tail is lined with cruelly hooked barbs, and it delights in destruction. When it approaches a coastal village, its tail shoots high into the air from beneath the waves, and it smashes all ships, docks, and nets in its path._

**_Coastal Destroyer_**. The isonade is a beast of destruction, sweeping away entire islands and villages. It wrecks seaside communities with battering winds and carves coastlines with its powerful magic. Though not very intelligent, it singles out a community and tries to lure residents into the waves with its animal messenger ability, sending gulls bearing confused riddles, grand promises, and eerie noises to the townsfolk.

**_Ocean Sacrifices_**. When coastal villagers suffered from a hurricane or tsunami, they fell back on folklore and blamed the stirrings of the dreaded isonade. To some, appeasing a leviathan such as this makes sense. Some say that a degenerate group seeks to draw the beast forth by sailing from sight of land and dumping a long chain of bound and screaming sacrifices into the lightless depths of the sea.

**_Enormous Age and Size_**. The isonade is more than 45 feet long. The beast's age is unknown, and many coastal bards tell some version of the legendâ€”some believe it is the last of its kind, others believe that a small group of isonade remains.
