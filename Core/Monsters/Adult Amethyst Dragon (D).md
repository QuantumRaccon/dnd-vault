## Description
---
Amethyst dragons are the most regal and magnanimous of the gem dragons. They speak in low tones that resonate with immense power, nevertheless choosing to treat all living creatures with dignity—unless those creatures prove undeserving. Their respect for life is so great that many refuse to eat animal flesh, even that of livestock, choosing instead to subsist on a diet of magically imbued gemstones.

**_Impartial Arbitrators_**. Amethyst dragons are accomplished diplomats, and they take special interest when war between dragons—or even between humanoids—threatens the stability of the land. If the stakes are truly dire, they seek out the warring factions' leaders to broker a peace. Amethyst dragons rarely interfere in smaller conflicts unless their aid is directly requested by a third party. They might answer the call as intermediaries but never enter a conflict on behalf of any side.
