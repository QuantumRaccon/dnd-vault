**_Angels of Death_**. Once beings of light and beauty who championed justice across the planes, the shadows of death formed after some agent of entropy discarded their bodies into the Void. Their celestial forms protected them from ultimate annihilation, but their minds were forever darkened by the plane's dread influence.

**_Deathly Avatars_**. Shadows of death sometimes answer the call of death cults. Rather than aiding the cultists though, the shadows kill the cultists before spreading the grave's shadow across the world.

**_Immortal Nature_**. The shadow of death doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
