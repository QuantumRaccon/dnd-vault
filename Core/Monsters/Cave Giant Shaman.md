## Description
---
>This massive, bipedal creature has a slight hunch, making its long arms appear even longer. It wields a massive club etched with sigils. A pair of yellow tusks, adorned with rings of all materials, protrudes from its lower jaw.

Cave giant shamans are gifted spellcasters who believe they are suited to consume spellcasting humanoids and absorb the humanoids' power. While the truth to this claim is dubious, there is no doubting their arcane prowess. They gravitate toward magic that allows them to change the composition of all materials, including air, flesh, and stone.
**_Practical Leader_**. Cave giant shamans are less superstitious than lesser [[cave giant \|cave giants]] (Creature Codex) and have learned to employ superstitions as a weapon to maintain power or convince the giants to do something they may not otherwise wish to do. Despite their more practical approaches to the world around them, cave giant shamans still jealously hoard the flesh of known spellcasters to sustain or enhance their power.
