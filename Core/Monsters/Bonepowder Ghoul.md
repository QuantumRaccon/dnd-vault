## Description
---
_Distilled to nothing but dry, whispering sand and a full set of teeth, a bonepowder ghoul still hungers for flesh and blood. Its dusty mass is perfected corruption, entirely animated by foul energy._

**_Starved Into Dust_**. The bonepowder ghoul is small and unassuming, a pile of dust and bone fragments that resemble a pile of mummy dust or the remnants of a vampire burned by sunlight. Ghouls can achieve this powdery form through long starvation. The process invariably takes decades, which is why so few bonepowder ghouls existâ€”few ghouls can show such self-restraint. Even among imperial ghouls, using hunger as a form of torture is considered offensive and is quite rare. A bonepowder ghoul may rise from the remnants of a starved prisoner or a ghoul trapped in a sealed-off cavern, leaving behind its remnant flesh and becoming animated almost purely by hunger, hatred, and the bitter wisdom of long centuries.

**_Mocking and Hateful_**. Bonepowder ghouls are creatures of pure evil, seeking to devour, corrupt, and destroy all living things. The only creatures they treat with some affinity are ghouls. Even in that case, their attitude is often mocking, hateful, or condescending. They have some mild respect for darakhul nobles.

**_Whispering Voices_**. Most bonepowder ghouls speak at least 4 languages, but their voices are very faint. Just to hear one speaking normally requires a DC 15 Perception check. Undead gain a +8 competence bonus to this check.
