## Description
---
>The bloody corpse stands up, dripping a red slime. As each drop hits the ground, it splatters into little red spores.

The crimson shambler is an intermediary form of a hazardous slime mold found in deep caverns. It wanders the dark passageways, attacking any creatures it encounters to infect them with its spores.
**_Gruesome Appearance_**. The crimson shambler is a mobile plant, feeding off the remains of an infected creature. The overlay of red slime atop an ambulatory decomposing corpse is often mistaken as some type of undead creature. In actuality, the remains are animated by a slime mold, allowing it to hunt and infect other creatures until it finds a suitable place to spawn. Then it falls and becomes a new colony of crimson slime.


> [!INFO] Crimson Slime Environmental Hazard
>This slime mold is bright red with darker blotches scattered over its surface. Crimson slime is usually encountered in warm, heavily forested areas or deep underground in areas full of living creatures for its spores. Crimson slime typically covers a 5-foot square. When a living creature moves within 10 feet of a crimson slime, the dark splotches on its surface burst and release spores in a 10-foot-radius around itself (see the crimson shambler's Spores trait for the effects of the spores). Ingestion of or physical contact with the crimson slime will also cause exposure to the spores. Crimson slime is immune to acid. Any effect that cures a disease or deals cold or fire damage destroys a path of crimson slime.
