## Description
---
>Blood drips from the lips of this crimson fiend.

**_Agents of Death_**. Blood imps are the devilish servants of gods of blood, death, and decay. On the Material Plane they are often found hastening the deaths of sacrifices and drinking spilled blood in the names of their masters.

**_Temple Bane_**. Blood imps despise the temples of gods of life and healing. The devils are driven to a mad rage when close to the altar of such a deity and go out of their way to defile or destroy it.


> [!INFO] Blood Imps in Midgard
>The Blood Goddess Marena makes frequent use of blood imps and is rarely seen without a pack of them nearby, receiving and delivering messages on her behalf. Her followers see the appearance of a blood imp as an auspicious event and a blessing. It is said several blood imps appeared at King Lucanís side during the siege of Krakova, each representing a Krakovan city, minus one—a sign from the Blood Goddess that he would not win all of the Electoral Kingdom.
> [!INFO] Blood Imp Familiars
>Blood imps often serve the followers of their deities and encourage those followers to shed blood wherever they go. Such imps have the following trait.
**_Familiar_**. The imp can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the imp senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the imp is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the imp's Magic Resistance trait. At any time and for any reason, the imp can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
