## Description
---
>This creature has gaudy green and purple feathers, stunted humanoid limbs, a cruel, vulture-like beak, and multiple eyes that swivel about on long, lime-colored stalks. It hoots diabolically as it approaches.

**_Wasteland Hunters_**. Desolate badlands, deserts, and wastelands warped by foul sorcery are the prime feeding grounds for these colorful aberrations, who use their vicious claws and beaks to kill and devour any creature they encounter. Due to their enormous size, they sometimes resort to eating rotting and undead flesh, and they can even eat rocks, plants, and dirt in a pinch. Because they are intelligent monsters, shukankors can be parlayed with, though their demands are usually extravagant and vile.

**_Strength in Numbers_**. The shukankor's ability to temporarily replicate itself aids it greatly in battle, especially when it is outnumbered or facing a particularly powerful opponent. These [[shukankor replica \|replicas]] are smaller, weaker clones of the shukankor that obey its telepathic commands and even sacrifice themselves to protect their creator. Shukankors are neither female nor male and reproduce by allowing their replicas to remain alive. After a day, these replicas become free-thinking and separate from the parent shukankor. A month later, they grow into full-sized shukankors with all the powers of their progenitor.
