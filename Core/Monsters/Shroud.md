## Description
---
_Shrouds appear much like they did in life, only translucent and immaterial. Their voices are weak._

**_Bitter Spirits_**. Shrouds are transitional creatures: remnants of wicked people who died but refuse to rest in peace, yet have not grown strong enough to become shadows. They are aggressive enemies of all living creatures and the light that nurtures life. Shrouds blend naturally into darkness, but they stand out starkly in bright light.

**_Thin Outlines_**. Shrouds look like flickering shadowy outlines of the people they were before they died, retaining the same height and body type.

**_Repetitive Speech_**. Shrouds cannot converse, but they occasionally can be heard cruelly whispering a name, term, or phrase over and over again: something that must have had meaning to them in life.
