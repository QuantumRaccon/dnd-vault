## Description
---
>A large, rotting heart floats forward, its hypnotic heartbeat echoing all around it.

**_Vampiric Hunters_**. An ortifex's singular purpose is to absorb blood from living creatures. When seeking blood, it disorients victims with an ominous, hypnotic heartbeat, then magically siphons their blood, leaving behind a shriveled carcass.

**_Harvested from Giants and Dragons_**. Only large hearts can be made into ortifexes, which are typically created from the hearts of giants, dragons, and particularly large beasts. Necromancers who create ortifexes for vampiric clients pay well for a sizeable heart, especially if it is minimally decomposed.

**_Agents of Oppression_**. When a blood cult, necromancer, or intelligent undead wants to demoralize a village or demand a sacrifice, it often sends an ortifex to collect payment in blood.

**_Undead Nature_**. An ortifex doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.

>The Red Sisters, who operate openly in the Greater Duchy of Morgau, regularly gift ortifexes as rewards for favors rendered. Recent reports tell of a secret meeting between King Lucan and Marena's high priestesses regarding the possibility of extracting the heart of a Dread Walker in the Wasted West and turning it into a massive ortifex for the Blood Kingdom.
