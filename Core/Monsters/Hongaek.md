## Description
---
>A faint disturbance signifies the presence of something terrible and evilâ€”an unnatural miasma. Suddenly, the hazy air coalesces into a mass of greenish fog with multiple red eyes and a dozen vaporous tentacles.

**_Harbingers of Pestilence_**. The hongaek is an elemental creature from the most stagnant and fouled regions of the Elemental Plane of Air. Its mere presence serves to strengthen and empower diseases and poisons in its proximity. Hongaeks typically arrive on the Material Plane through planar portals in areas where pestilence and famine are rampant, but they are occasionally summoned by death cults or by those who venerate gods of plague or poison.

**_Elemental Hatred_**. Hongaeks are thoroughly evil and hate land-dwelling lifeforms like humans and elves. They detest other elemental creatures just as much, and battles between them are not uncommon where their territories on the planes meet.

**_Elemental Nature_**. The hongaek doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
