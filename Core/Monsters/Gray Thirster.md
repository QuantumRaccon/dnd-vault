## Description
---
_This dried-out body of a long dead traveler is still clad in the tattered remains of his clothes. Skin as dry as parchment clings to the bones that are clearly distinguishable underneath. A hoarse moaning emanates from the dry, cracked lips._

**_Thirsting Undead_**. The greatest danger to people traversing badlands and deserts is thirst, and even the best prepared can find themselves without water. The lucky ones die quickly, while those less fortunate linger in sun-addled torment for days. These souls sometimes rise from the sand as gray thirsters, driven to inflict the torment they suffered upon other travelers.

**_Destroy Wells and Oases_**. Gray thirsters destroy or foul sources of water and often lurk nearby to ambush those seeking clean water.

**_Thirsting Caravan_**. Though they hunt alone, in at least one case an entire caravan died of thirst and rose again as gray thirsters. Called the dust caravan, it prowls the deep desert accompanied by skinchanging gnolls, shrieking ghouls, and a mummy lord, building a strange nomadic army.
