## Description
---
>A cloud of unconnected, flat gray triangles in the vague shape of a mantis flickers unpredictably from one position to another, clicking softly as its arm blades swing outward.

Akaasits are constructed beings from a plane destroyed by a catastrophic misuse of time magic. They were altered by this catastrophe and now exist in the present and in fractions of a second in the past and future.
**_Mindless_**. The akaasit has no mind, at least as understood by denizens of the Material Plane, and its motives are inscrutable. Each akaasit is always found moving toward some unknown destination. It may attack other creatures, or it may ignore them. It protects itself if attacked, but rarely does an akaasit pursue a retreating foe.

**_Unknown Origin_**. The home of the akaasit is unknown, but they are often encountered in areas touched or altered by time magic. Although a few wizards have discovered magical methods of summoning them, none have found a way to control or communicate with them. Akaasits seem to be drawn to spellcasters with some mastery of time magic, though it is always a gamble if an individual akaasit will protect or ruthlessly attack such a spellcaster. An akaasit's demeanor can change each day, and many time magic spellcasters have been found slain by the same akaasit that faithfully protected them the day prior.

**_Dispersed Destruction_**. If an akaasit is destroyed, it falls apart into a pile of gray triangles. These triangles fade out of existence over the next ten minutes, leaving only the akaasit's two armblades.

**_Construct Nature_**. The akaasit doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


> [!INFO] Akaasit Blade
>_Weapon ({@item dagger|phb_), rare
>You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
>This dagger is crafted from the armblades of a defeated akaasit. You can use an action to activate a small measure of prescience within the dagger for 1 minute. If you are attacked by a creature you can see within 5 feet of you while this effect is active, you can use your reaction to make one attack with this dagger against the attacker. If your attack hits, the dagger loses its prescience, and its prescience can't be activated again until the next dawn.
