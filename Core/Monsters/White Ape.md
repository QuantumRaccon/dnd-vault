## Description
---
_This hulking primate looms over others of its kind. Its filthy white fur is matted and yellowed, and a deranged look haunts its blood-red eyes._

**_Awakened by Sorcery_**. White apes were once docile, gentle giants that roamed forested hills and savannah lands. Two thousand years ago, a kingdom of mages awakened the apes, raising their intelligence to near-human level so the beasts could be employed as soldiers and servants, protecting and replacing the humans who were slowly dying off. When the sorcerers died out, the apes remained.

**_Arcane Wasting_**. The enchantment that imbued the apes with intelligence also bleached their fur white and made them carriers of the [[arcane wasting]], a disease that hastened their creators' demise. The apes are immune to the wasting's effects, but they can pass it to other humanoids. Among spellcasters, the wasting spreads like a plague.

**_Driven Away_**. The awakening enchantment also gave the white apes a strong desire to serve humans, but because of the risk from the disease, they are viciously driven away from settled areas. They are acutely aware of the injustice that was done to them, and generations of exile have turned their loyalty to animosity, especially toward arcane spellcasters.

> [!INFO] White Apes in Midgard
>In the Southlands, the white apes were created by the mages of the Empire of Morreg. Nearly 100 years ago, the apes were the source of a major outbreak of the [[arcane wasting]] in Morreg and Lignas. It has never quite disappeared, and it remains a threat all along the western coast.
