## Description
---
>A humanoid torso rises from a long, arthropod body made from overlapping plates of obsidian. The creature's face is twisted into a grimace of rage. Four arms ending in oversized fists jut from the torso. The creature's form radiates a red glow and a palpable heat as a fire rages within it.

**_Corrupted Keepers_**. The elemental anomaly that brings a [[lava keeper]] into the Material Plane is sometimes infused with material from the Lower Planes. As the keeper is pulled into the Material Plane, the lava that normally flows freely from it is instead trapped inside of it, and its form twists to resemble creatures from the Lower Planes. These twisted keepers are known as cherufes.

**_Harbingers of Ruin_**. The arrival of a cherufe is frequently the precursor to a devastating volcanic eruption or earthquake. Cherufe revel in the anxiety and fear humanoids feel in the face of such natural disasters, capitalizing on these feelings to their benefit.

**_Placated by Blood_**. Cherufe lair where populations are superstitious and allow these civilizations to worship them as gods of destruction. They amplify the fear and adulation of the populace with random acts of destruction. If the locals offer live sacrifices, the cherufe eagerly devour the offerings and cease their hostilities until they once again grow hungry or restless.

**_Elemental Nature_**. A cherufe doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
