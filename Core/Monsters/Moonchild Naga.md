## Description
---
_This great serpent with shimmering scales of varying colors has the face of a beautiful woman. Its eyes shine like the moon in a sea of stars, and it sways to an unheard rhythm._

**_Starry Gaze_**. The pupils and irises of a moonchild naga appear as moons in miniature, surrounded by black sclera dotted with faintly glowing stars. The moonchild naga uses its eyes to claim a connection to the powers of the moon and the stars, which grants it powers of prophecy. The bewitching power in their gaze lends some credence to these claims.

**_Manipulative Masters_**. These nagas excel at manipulation, convincing those who listen of their own hidden greatness, and that, through time spent in communion and service to the naga, they can unlock their true potential. Through ritual deprivation, drug-induced visions, the promised revelation of great secrets that never come, and the reinforcement of the naga's own place in their lives, moonchild nagas never lack for a small cadre of underlings to do their bidding.

**_Two is a Crowd_**. Moonchild nagas avoid one another for fear that another will spoil their efforts or expose them as charlatans in order to make off with their devotees.
