## Description
---
_A tall, spindly humanoid covered in dark fur lumbers forward. Its lupine skull hosts pointed ears ending in tufts of fur and small, black eyes, which glow with reflected light. Sharp spines protrude from its hunched back._

Primarily living alone, the nalusa falaya seem to mutter to themselves for company. In a few cases, they ally themselves with [[zoog \|zoogs]] or spiders and may refer to these creatures as their "children."

**_Unsavory Appetites_**. The nalusa falaya's jaw hosts terrifying teeth, and its eyes gleam in even the dimmest light. Humanoid young are their favorite delicacy, and many nalusa falaya have a particular appetite for elven young.

**_Shadow Walkers_**. While this evil and devious creature may walk as a humanoid, its form has been seen to slither like a snake from shadow to shadow, where it disappears from sight. It is rumored that these creatures were once mortals but have been corrupted by energies from the Void.

**_Portal Wardens_**. The nalusa falaya are often drawn to portals leading to or from planes of shadow, death, and darkness. These portals may resemble dark ponds, shadowy wells full of peculiar echoes, or even dark caverns covered in spiraling runes. When losing a battle, they sometimes disappear into shadow and never return.
