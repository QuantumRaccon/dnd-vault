## Description
---
_These large water-striding insects resemble a strange cross between camels and wingless, long-legged locusts. A rider can comfortably sit in the large hollow in the small of their backs, even at high speeds or on choppy water. Riders use the gerridae's long, looping antennae to steer._

**_Elvish Water Steeds_**. Known by their Elvish name, these large fey water striders were enchanted and bred by the elves in ages past, when their explorers roamed the world. Elven mages started with normal water striders and—through elaborate magical procedures and complex cross-breeding programs—transformed the mundane water striders into large, docile mounts. They can cross large bodies of water quickly while carrying a humanoid rider, even in windy conditions.

**_Sturdy Mounts_**. A gerridae can carry up to 300 pounds of rider and gear before being encumbered, or 600 while encumbered.

**_Fond of Sweet Scents_**. Gerridae can sometimes be distracted by appealing scents, such as apple blossom or fresh hay. They are also fond of raw duck and swan.

> [!INFO] Gerridae in Midgard
>Since the elven retreat from Midgard almost 500 years ago, many of the gerridae have gone feral, and while normally shy and docile, they can attack in furious swarms if hunted or surprised in their claimed territories. Some enterprising elfmarked Barsellan pirates have domesticated them and use the water striders as chasers and boarding craft when taking on Bemmean and Septime ships.
