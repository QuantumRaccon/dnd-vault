## Description
---
_These scaly creatures resemble nothing so much as tiny, batwinged dragonkin._

**_Dragon Sprites_**. Chernomoi (which means "lair sprite" in Draconic) often reside discreetly in a dragon lair or dragonborn household, cleaning and tidying up at night, and only occasionally keeping a small trinket or shiny gemstone as compensation. They appear as tiny, winged dragonkin, dressed in metallic armor made of small coins and semi-precious stones.

**_Lair Alarms_**. Chernomoi are terrified of wyverns and never lair anywhere near them. Otherwise, they are very protective of their draconic masters and raise an alarm if an intruder is undetected. They fight with their tiny blades and Shriek attack if cornered, though they always flee from danger as a first optionâ€”usually straight to a dragon, dragonborn, or drake ally.

> [!INFO] Chernomoi in Midgard
>Dragons of the Mharoti Empire consider chernomoi cute little guardian pets, and treat them roughly the way humans treat a parrot or pet bird. In some cases, chernomoi serve elder dragons as familiars and messengers, dressed in completely dazzling armor made of gemstones. Their golden armor is a sign of their master's wealth and power.
