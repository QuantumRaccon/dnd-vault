## Description
---
_These clicking, turquoise-colored beetles have faintly luminescent golden glyphs on their backs, which grow brighter as they draw near._

Manabane scarabs are vermin infused with the ancient magic of fallen desert empires.

**_Devour Magic_**. Whether from gnawing on the flesh of the undead or nesting in areas rife with lingering enchantment, these beetles have developed a taste for the power of magic even as its power has marked them. The graven glyphs on their carapaces resemble the priestly cuneiform of long-dead kingdoms, and the more magical energy they consume, the brighter they glow, up to the equivalent of a torch.
Manabane scarabs pursue magic without hesitation or fear, tirelessly seeking to drain it for sustenance.
