## Description
---
_Within the moonlight spilling through the window, a shadow coalesces into a lovely female form. Although the figure's body is wraith-like, the face is distinct. A dark smile plays across fine lips, while her eyes sparkle like cold diamonds._

**_Children of the Night_**. The passages and fissures between the mortal world and the realms beyond are many and diverse. One such bridge is enabled by the moons of the mortal realm. Moon nymphs, as they are called, use those portals to move into the world, traveling down moonbeams to haunt mortals' dreams.

**_Daughters of the Moon_**. Those who observe a moon nymph and live to tell the tale describe a slight humanoid creature, wraithlike in form but with a countenance as beautiful as the most alluring fairy. In reality, moon nymphs are genderless, taking on a visage that matches the dreams of their victims. Some might see a beautiful elf, others a handsome dwarf, and lovers of animals might even see a sleek feline or an adorable canine.
Regardless of the form, the moon nymph appears in muted colors, mostly shadowy blacks or pale whites and yellows. Their bodies are often hazy and ghostly at the edges, but the facial features are clearly defined and mesmerizing.

>The moon nymph's connection to the moon affects its power as the cycles of the moon progress. The statistics given represent a moon nymph during a crescent or gibbous moon. During full moons, the challenge rating increases by 1, the creature's hp maximum increases by 30, it has advantage on attack rolls, and all saving throw DCs increase by 1. Inversely, during new moons, the challenge rating decreases by 1 as the numbers move in the opposite direction.
