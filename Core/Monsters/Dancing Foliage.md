## Description
---
>A slender, humanoid-shaped plant dances in a clearing. Its two long legs and four arms are decorated with a plethora of vibrant petals and serrated leaves. A wide flower blossoms at the top of the whimsical performer.

**_Jovial Creations_**. Dancing foliage appears in areas where the magic of the arts combines with the magic of nature. Birthed by such magic, the creature is influenced by both: it loves the arts and is protective of the natural world.

**_Garden Guardians_**. Dancing foliage primarily inhabits and defends forest groves from outside threats, but they sometimes wander the gardens of urban settlements. Their love of flowers causes them to tend and protect the plants at all costs, often to the dismay of the garden's owner or castle groundskeeper. Once a dancing foliage has decided to protect an area, it refuses to leave, though terms of pruning and planting can be negotiated with it, especially if such actions make the garden more aesthetically pleasing.

**_Dancing Gardeners_**. When tending to its garden, dancing foliage moves to some unheard tune, gracefully leaping, twirling, and bobbing around the garden. If it or its garden is threatened, the dancing foliage enters a battle dance until the threat is either removed or eliminated. It never pursues foes beyond the end of its garden.
