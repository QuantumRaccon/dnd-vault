## Description
---
No matter the difference in honor between chromatic and metallic dragons, one would be hard-pressed to argue that they aren't noble creatures. The inverse is true of Ooze Dragons; beings so strange that not even the ever-changing layers of Limbo can spit them out. Only one ooze dragon has been publicly known to exist, though it is whispered there are more. Born as an experiment of a crazed alchemist who sought to create a weapon so powerful none could oppose them. Over years of work and arcane horrors, a wyrmlings flesh and blood was warped to become translucent and gelatinous. The dragon was driven mad by this process, however, eventually killing its creator and escaping into the wild.

**_Digestive Tactics_**. Those few who claim to have met an ooze dragon and lived to tell the tale, usually do not come back whole. Due to its amorphous body, the ooze dragon can absorb creatures and eat away at their flesh with its caustic ichor, melting those who cannot escape within minutes. Trails of halfdigested flora and fauna can be found in the wake of the dragon, and entire skeletons are commonly found here too.

**_Terrible Reminder_**. The body of an ooze dragon is entirely molded out of a translucent blue gel that loosely grips the last remaining elements of a vestigial skeleton. An entire skull is present but missing its bottom jaw, its spine and ribcage float aimlessly in its malformed torso and the claws in its feet remain. Empty eye sockets peer out of the skull but it is clear the creature can still see. In the center of the beast, a large heart has ceased beating and crystallized into a deep red gem that glistens in the light.

**_Without Purpose_**. None are sure what an ooze dragon wants, but most agree that neither does the dragon itself. It takes no permanent lair, does not attempt to communicate with other dragons and seems to have no interest in collecting treasure or relics of importance. It ignores humanoids when it can and swiftly deals with any threats without attempting diplomacy. Most regard it as a force of nature and simply stay out of its way, but others have noticed from patterns of movement that it seems to be searching; for what, no one knows.
