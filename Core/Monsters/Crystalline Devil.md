## Description
---
_Created and favored by Mammon, the arch-devil of greed, crystalline devils masquerade as magic treasures._

**_Barefoot, Gem-Coated_**. Crystalline devils resemble gem.coated humanoids with cruel, twisted faces, jagged teeth, and terrible talons like shards of broken glass. Their feet, however, are soft and bare, allowing them to pad along with surprising stealth, always looking for a favorable spot to assume gem form.

**_Winking Jewels_**. In its treasure form, a crystalline devil resembles a pretty, sparkling jewel lying on the ground, glowing with a warm inner light. They seek to catch the eye of an unwary creature whose mind it might corrupt to greed and murder. If their identity is discovered in gem form, they reassume their normal form and attack.

**_Passed Along_**. After insinuating themselves into groups, they encourage betrayal and murder, then persuade a host to pass on their treasure as atonement for their crimes.




The crystalline devil has a 25 percent chance of summoning one crystalline devil.
