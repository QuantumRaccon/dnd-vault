## Description
---
_This shambling corpse warrior is draped in stained linen wrappings. Green liquid drips from rents in the fabric._

**_Servant of the Scorpion Goddess_**. These mummies are crafted by Selket's faithful to guard holy sites and tombs and to serve as agents of the goddess's retribution. Should Selket or her faithful feel themselves slighted by an individual or a community, they perform dangerous rituals to awaken these creatures from the crypts of her temples. Venomous mummies delight in wreaking deadly vengeance against those who disrespect the goddess.

**_Death to Blasphemers_**. In most cases, retribution is limited to people who actually undertook the acts of blasphemy, but if her priests determine that an entire community has grown heretical and earned Selket's wrath, they may set mummies loose against the entire populace.

**_Deadly Smoke_**. Burning a venomous mummy is a terrible idea; the smoke of their immolation is toxic.
