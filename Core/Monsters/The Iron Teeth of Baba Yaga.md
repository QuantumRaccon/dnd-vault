## Description
---
_A set of iron dentures flap through the air, screeching in a voice like metal scraping on metal._

**_Scholar_**. The dentures are scholars of the arcane and are often found exploring ruins, especially ancient sites of magic. They see themselves as intellectually superior to their owner and chastise Baba Yaga for her use of baser forms of magic.

**_Wilful_**. The iron teeth are usually content sitting firmly in Baba Yaga's mouth, assisting the witch. However, should she anger the dentures, either by ignoring their request to visit some forgotten tower or scolding them too much for insolence, the dentures may abandon her for a while. They may work against her if the two are particularly at odds.
