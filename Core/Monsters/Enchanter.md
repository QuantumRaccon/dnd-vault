Masters of arcane manipulation, enchanters often make themselves indispensible to diplomats when dealing with belligerent enemies, though some enchanters seek only to empower themselves at the expense of others.

**_Quietly Dangerous_**. Most enchanters conceal the true depths of their power from those around them to insinuate themselves into halls of power and to bend the wills of those who can make the world more suitable to their desires.


**_Fey Diplomats_**. Enchanters are often seen as companions, lords, or wardens of other fey; they speak with unicorns, accept fealty from gnomes, sprites, [[leonino]], or [[fey drake \|fey drakes]], and sometimes conjure aerial spirits as servants, friends, or lovers. They have a knack for finding the uncanny side of the living world and are beloved by the fey lords and ladies.
