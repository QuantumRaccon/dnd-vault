## Description
---
>A shaggy rug made from the skin of a bear suddenly rises up like a billowing sheet. The head snaps its jaws and the whole thing lunges forward, flat and threatening.

Animated bearskin rugs are exactly what their name suggests: bearskin rugs given life by magic.
**_Inn Protection_**. Inns and hunting lodges in remote locations often hire mages to make animated bearskin rugs. The rugs serve as seemingly harmless decorations that can instantly turn into guardians to drive away burglars, or into bouncers to break up bar fights.

**_Bearserk_**. There are rare cases of animated bearskin rugs suddenly going berserk and refusing to follow the commands of their masters. It is unknown what triggers such violence in the constructs. Berserk rugs need to be put down swiftly, as they attack any creature they notice.

**_Construct Nature_**. An animated bearskin rug doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
