## Description
---
_A grinning elf with snow white skin and jet-black hair holds up her hand authoritatively, blocking the path forward._

**_Agents of the Shadow Roads_**. Shadow fey knights of the road stalk the lands near shadow gates, or the shadow roads themselves, ever-watchful for opportunities to enrich themselves or improve their station, be it through robbery, ransom, or murder.


**_Opportunists and Climbers_**. These shadow elves, often out-of-favor minor nobility, study every nook and cranny of the territory in which they work. They use their accumulated knowledge against their quarry with great effect in the hopes of using new wealth, knowledge, and infamy to curry favor with their betters.


**_Never Far from Home._**. Knights of the road prefer to fight, hunt, threaten, and do other business in the Shadow Realm, though they are active anywhere that connects to it.
