## Description
---
_The pile of color-changing ooze springs to life on the refuse heap behind an alchemical laboratory._

**_It's Alive!_**. Alchemical apprentice oozes form spontaneously from the waste product of alchemy labs. The creatures do not travel far from the source of their birth, as it is often the only supply of food in the region.

**_Assistants and Guardians_**. Alchemists keep these oozes as pets and assistants in their labs. The creatures possess a surprising intelligence pertaining to alchemy and can help an alchemist in her work. They require little care and can survive a very long time on a small pile of sulfur or similar compounds. They seem to absorb minerals and garbage without ill effect. The oozes often offer protection to a laboratory, as their survival is linked to its continued usage.

**_Burbling and Bubbling Sounds_**. When an alchemical apprentice ooze uses its telepathy, it emits a series of blurbs, blops, and other rather liquid and sometimes almost-sensible sounds. Those hearing these noises often become convinced it is a dialect of Aquan.

**_Ooze Nature_**. An alchemical apprentice ooze doesn't require sleep.
