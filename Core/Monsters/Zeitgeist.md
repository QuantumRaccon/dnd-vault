## Description
---
>The mumbling humanoid alternates between bursts of speed and inactivity as it struggles to focus on the reality around it.

Caught in a chronological maelstrom, zeitgeists struggle to interact with whatever reality presents itself in that moment. Zeitgeists are humanoids who were warped by some misuse or accident of time magic. They are "ghosts" of time, flittering from plane to plane, timeline to timeline, unable to anchor themselves with any sort of stability for long.
**_Fast and Slow_**. Warped by time magic, a zeitgeist finds itself alternating between speeding around its foes and being barely able to keep up with them. This alternating is random and outside of the zeitgeist's control, often pulling it forward in the middle of a conversation or slowing it when attempting to escape an enemy.

**_Unstable Body and Mind_**. The constant instability of being pulled between planes and timelines leaves zeitgeists unable to focus, at best, and deranged, at worst. If a moment of clarity pierces its madness, a zeitgeist might attempt a quick conversation or simply remain motionless, enjoying the temporary reprieve from its tortured existence.

**_Still Living_**. Though named "ghosts," zeitgeists aren't dead; rather, something mysterious about their situation sustains them. Similar to a [[ghost]], a zeitgeist might be tied to a particular location, albeit at different points in time. The location might be the site of the magical mishap that created it, a place steeped in planar or time magic, or a place stable enough in time to help the zeitgeist anchor itself and its sanity.

**_Timewarped Nature_**. A zeitgeist doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
