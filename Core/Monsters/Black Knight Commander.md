## Description
---
The black knight commander strikes an imposing figure upon his chosen mount; one that inspires bloodlust in his allies and fear in his foes. Devoted to his own twisted code, the black knight commander has a sense of honor but he spares no compassion for those who stand in his way. Whether he fights for a dark lord or a demonic god, all of his foes will be trampled into the dust and their families slaughtered so there can be no revenge. The only victory is a total victory.
