## Description
---
_This magnificent creature has the head of a human, the body of a lion, and the golden wings of an eagle. It turns and smiles benevolently at all the travelers it meets._

**_Ancient Protectors_**. Lamassu are dedicated to battling the forces of evil and protecting sites of historic and religious importance from harm. Most of the time, they inhabit abandoned temples and other ruins in deserts and protect those sites from foul monsters. Kind and compassionate towards humanoids, their regal bearing and archaic turns of phrase can sometimes make them seem aloof and superior.

**_Adopting a City_**. A lamassu will sometimes leave its ruins and adopt a humanoid city, simply by nesting in its largest gatehouse and inspecting the people and creatures that pass through the gate. In these situations, a protective lamassu watches for known criminals, offers blessings to the poor, and sometimes demands donations from the wealthy to assist beggars, widows, and orphans. In most cases, this role as a gate lamassu ends after a year and a day, but it can last up to a decade. Watch captains, merchants, and city rulers have attempted flattery, bribery, and carefullyâ€‘worded proclamations but nothing seems to dissuade a city lamassu.

**_Immortal Nature_**. A lamassu doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
