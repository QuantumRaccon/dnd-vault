## Description
---
_A brightly dressed figure wears a rakish wide-brimmed hat. The figure has a blend of human and fox features, smiling as it draws its rapier from the sheath at its hip._

Reynard, the Fox Lord and the Laughing Trickster, is a man‑sized hybrid creature that blends a humanoid form with the features of a fox. In his true form, his body is covered in short, smooth red fur, and he has a bushy tail with a white tip. In any form, his eyes are the bright yellow-green of spring buds. He delights in leading hunters on merry chases, leaving them hopelessly lost in the woods surrounding his home. He sometimes makes it a game to strand such a group indefinitely, until they starve to death.

**_Irreverent Jester_**. Reynard can't stand people who are full of themselves. This group automatically includes all rulers and authority figures, and he sees it as a personal mission to help such stodgy folk loosen up and enjoy life. He's usually oblivious to the disarray and outright danger his pranks, meant to help them unwind, ultimately wreak on their lives.


**_Master of Hidden Paths_**. Reynard knows a vast number of secret paths and shortcuts, which he regularly uses to escape hunters, adventurers, and revenge from fey more powerful than himself who don't appreciate his sense of humor. Tales tell that the paths and burrows of Reynard's home can lead anywhere in the multiverse.


**_Reynard's Lair_**. Reynard lives in Malperdy, an underground manor of twisted hallways, burrow-like tunnels, and secret chambers. When outmatched, he makes for one of the many bolt-hole entrances to Malperdy, intent on leaving his pursuers hopelessly lost in its halls. If the tales are true, Malperdy's tunnels and hallways lead to distant locations as well as to other planes of existence.
> [!INFO] Reynard and the Other Fey Lords & Ladies
>Reynard is fairly solitary and visits fey courts only occasionally, though he enjoys them immensely. Most of the time, he is welcomed formally, asked to behave, and then thrown out when things go horribly wrong. The [[Lord of the Hunt]] (Tome of Beasts), Reynard's implacable foe and rival, considers the Fox Lord a worthless and selfish creature. However, some of this is surely professional jealousy; Reynard prides himself on avoiding the Wild Hunt with ease and aplomb. The [[Snow Queen]] is occasionally friendly to Reynard, known to feed him roast winter hares fresh from the spit in exchange for diverting jokes, gossip, and (if rumor be believed) kisses, gifts, and endearments best left to those involved—at other times, she harries him with constant storms, snow, and frost. The [[Bear King]] finds Reynard tiresome and frivolous after a day or a week, though the two do enjoy occasional evenings of song and story together. The [[Queen of Night and Magic]] considers Reynard a foolish, foppish, and deeply unreliable Fey Lord, and she trusts him with nothing. The [[Queen of Witches]] likewise has relatively little good to say about Reynard, though he claims this is because he often gets the better of her in illusions and witchery. Berchta, by contrast, seems to be the one Fey Lady to truly see some good in Reynard. Because of her ability to see and mend fate, she occasionally entrusts Reynard with an important task—and he has never yet disappointed her.
