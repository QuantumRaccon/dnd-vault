## Description
---
>This pile of rotting plant matter is shaped similarly to a woolly mammoth, without the tusks. The plants forming its hide droop to the ground.

**_Elephantine Plant Mound_**. The peat mammoth is a mobile peat bog on four, stumpy legs. The plants draping from it give it the shaggy appearance of a wooly mammoth. It can extrude parts of its plant mound to strike at foes, but it mostly ambles over prey, absorbing them into its mass.

**_Spirit-infused_**. Peat mammoths are mounds of plant material inhabited and driven by the souls of intelligent creatures that died in peat bogs. The restless spirits steer the mammoth's movements, but the jumble of trapped souls leaves the mammoth without a true pilot or goal. Thus, the plant matter shambles onward, absorbing creatures and plants in its path, driven by the energy of spirits seeking release yet unable to find it.

**_Swamp Gas Hazard_**. The rotting plant and animal material contained within the peat mammoth's mass give off flammable swamp gases. The mammoth's saturated body gives it a measure of protection from fire, but the gases escaping from it easily catch fire. In rare instances, attacking the mammoth with fire results in a terrible explosion.
