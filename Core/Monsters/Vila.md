## Description
---
_These beautiful, slim women ride on large deer, their hair the color of spring grass, skin like polished wood, and eyes as gray as a coming storm._

**_Dryad Cousins_**. The vila are kin to the dryads. Like their cousins, they serve as protectors of the deepest forests.

**_Demand Oaths_**. Where dryads beguile to accomplish their goals, the vila coerce and threaten. They demand oaths from interlopers and enforce them fiercely. Vila delight in testing the virtue of travelers and tormenting the uncharitable and cruel with bad weather and misfortune. Particularly obnoxious adventurers might suffer bad luck for months because a troop of vila quietly dances around their camp each night.

**_Hunt with a Pack_**. Vila rarely travel or fight alone; they are often seen in the company of alseid, wolves, wampus cats, or deer. In combat, they sometimes ride on fleet-footed deer, the better to escape if events turn against them.

>The vila are servants to Baba Yaga, and she does not deny them. She has many such daughters, an entire nation at her command, though she rarely calls on them. When she does, though, her dutiful children answer her call by the hundreds. They live in the depths of the Margreve Forest and the Ghost Wood, among other places, and are somewhat friendly with the daughters of Perun.
