## Description
---


Some husk zombies become bloated with disease and bile, their frenzied state pushing them to rush other living creatures, explode, and spread their horrid infection. A husk zombie burster has the following additional action option:

**_Burst_**. The zombie explodes and is destroyed. Each creature within 5 feet of it must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 14 (**4d6**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A humanoid creature killed by this damage rises as a [[husk zombie]] after 1 minute.
