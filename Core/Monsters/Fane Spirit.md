## Description
---
>As the sun gently dips below the horizon, the priest undergoes a startling transformation, his benevolent form replaced by the ghastly countenance of death.

**_Temple Ghosts_**. When a lawful individual dies defending a place of worship such as a temple, shrine, or other holy site, it sometimes rises as a fane spirit bound to the site, protecting it even in death. Most fane spirits were formerly clerics, though druids, paladins, and even lay worshippers can become fane spirits under the right circumstances. Fane spirits are lawful and typically only attack those who discover their undead nature or who try to harm their place of worship.

**_Welcoming Priests_**. During daylight hours, fane spirits appear to be living creatures, carrying on the same tasks they did when they were alive. Normal methods for detecting undead creatures do not work on them, and, unless attacked or injured, they show no outward signs of their true nature. This deception extends to the fane spirit itself, as it does not have any recollection of dying or of its time in its undead form. When this deception is revealed, the fane spirit becomes enraged with suffering and lashes out at those who made it remember.

**_Undead Nature_**. The fane spirit doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
