## Description
---
_Vættir are ancestral spirits, sometimes protective and helpful but demanding reverence and wrathful when offended._

**_Servants of the Land_**. Land vættir dwell in barrows while sea vættir live beneath lakes, rivers, or the sea—both wear ancient mail and carry bronzes axes in withered hands. Servants of the land, they haunt those who disrespect the wild or ancient laws and traditions.

**_Jealous and Wrathful_**. A wrathful vættir rises from its mound when its grave goods are stolen (including heirlooms passed on to living descendants) or when they are disrespected (leaving the dragon prow attached to a longship is a common offense, as is failing to make offerings). Vættir jealously guard both honor and treasures, and may be relentless enemies over matters as small as an accidental word or a single coin.

**_Dangerous Helpers_**. A vættir's blue-black skin is stretched taut over its bones and sinews and its lips are drawn back in a cruel grimace. A rarer, bone-white variety exists that cares little for material possessions, instead guarding their honor or a particular patch of land. Both varieties will answer a summons by descendants or nearby villages. The summoned vættir will wander into longhouses or taverns and sit down beside those who call them, ready to serve. However, there's always a price and a vættir's help is often more than bargained for.
