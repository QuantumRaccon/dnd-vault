## Description
---
_An iron ball covered in black panels sits at the statue's feet. It seems slightly out of place, its surface smooth and bright._

**_Hidden Threat_**. From a distance, the iron sphere appears to be a ball four feet in diameter. Closer inspection reveals square plates in the sphere, each crowned by a black hemisphere. Iron spheres usually find placement as art objects, sometimes incorporated into statuary displays or among white stones, vases, or other decorative notions.


**_Unpredictable Opponent_**. Once the iron sphere becomes active, it rolls toward a threat, deploying what weapons it deems necessary by means of the pistons beneath each plate on its exterior. Some pop open like a chest's lid, some fire outward, and others split open to reveal a blade, a spike, or a nozzle.


**_Direct Control or Set to Guard_**. The owner of an iron sphere gives it commands through a gem, which can be concealed inside the plate at the topmost part of the sphere when not being used to control the sphere.


**_Construct Nature_**. The inkling doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
