## Description
---
_The amphiptere is most commonly found as a flight of gold-crested, bat-winged serpents bursting from the foliage._

**_Tiny Wyverns_**. An amphiptere has batlike wings and a stinger similar to a wyvern's at the end of its tail. Their reptilian bodies are scaly, but their wings sprout greenish-yellow feathers.

**_Swooping and Swift_**. They are surprisingly maneuverable in spite of their size, able to change direction suddenly and make deadly hit-and-run strikes. They swoop in and out of combat, snapping at targets with their needlelike teeth and striking with their envenomed stingers. Once a foe is poisoned and injured, they hover closer in a tightly packed, flapping mass of fangs, battering wings, and jabbing stingers.

**_Strength in Flocks_**. Despite their fighting ability, amphipteres are not particularly brave. Most often, they tend to lurk in small flocks in dense foliage, where they can burst forth in a flurry of wings when prey comes within view. They display surprising cunning and tenacity in large groups; they may harass foes for minutes or hours before closing in for the kill.
