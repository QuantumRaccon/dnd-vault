## Description
---
Like his totem, the wolf reaver dwarf travels in a pack with his brothers in arms looking for worthy challenges to prove himself. Rushing into battle beside his allies for glory as much as plunder, the wolf reaver dwarf throws caution to the wind and fights without care for his own safety.
