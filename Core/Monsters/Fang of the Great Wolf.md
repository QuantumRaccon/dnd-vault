## Description
---
_The light of reason in the large worg's eyes is unmistakable; it is a cunning beast, able to work together with goblin or worg allies to lure victims into ambushes or down dead-end paths._

**_Bestial Priests_**. A worg becomes a fang of the Great Wolf through the workings and rituals of the bestial cults of the Great Wolf, who seek out the craftiest of worgs for this honor. Once absorbed into the cult, the worgs serve more intelligent and powerful creatures such as werewolves and [[nightgarms]] (Tome of Beasts, p. 304), aiding them in keeping large packs of varied lupine beasts in order.

**_Trophy Takers_**. Few things make a fang of the Great Wolf happier than tearing the arm rings from northern warriors and wearing them as trophies. When two or more fangs gather in one place, they compare and boast to one another about how the trophies were taken.

**_No Thrall to Humanoids_**. After its transformation from a standard worg to a fang of the Great Wolf and its induction into the cult, the fang will not tolerate being ridden by any humanoid, including goblins and hobgoblins, though it may let one get close enough to try before making a meal of it.
