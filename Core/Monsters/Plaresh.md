## Description
---
_A squelching mass of fleshy worms twists and writhes. Thousands of thin bodies twine together, smooth skin and barbed segments giving way to eyeless heads with screeching, hissing maws. Green ichor drools from the mouths where tiny, needle-like teeth gleam._

Plaresh demons arise from the slime and offal left behind in the wake of Qorgeth, Demon Lord of the Devouring Worm (Tome of Beasts, p. 90). Individually, these tiny worm demons are little more than a disgusting nuisance. When they band together into writhing masses hundreds or even thousands strong, the story changes drastically. The plaresh is an amalgamation of these demonic slivers, each linked into a cruel hive mind driven to common purpose in the service of the Writhing Prince.

**_Devoured Tribute_**. Plaresh demons are more intelligent than any mortal vermin, but their lord's insatiable hunger overwhelms complex thought. Sometimes they act with a disturbing purpose which hints at a greater intelligence or plan, but mostly they exist to eat. When they devour a humanoid corpse, they send the unfortunate creature's soul to Qorgeth's tunnelâ€‘realm, and a new plaresh slips through in the wake of the soul's passing.
