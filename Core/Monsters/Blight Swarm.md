## Description
---
The Blight Swarm is a cruel mixture of shambling mound and blights. These creatures are combined into one horrific swarm, which scuttles, shambles and drags itself around using its many plant-like appendages. It is created when a number of smaller plants are infected with evil spirit and malevolence; the spirit combines the resources around it to create a Blight Swarm.

**_Draining Presence_**. The blight swarm moves through nearby vegetation choking the life from it; it will climb trees, force its roots into them to strangle and eventually kill them; the blight swarm is a murderous evil essence and so seeks out life to kill and then drain.
