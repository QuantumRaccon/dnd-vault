## Description
---
>The tiny winged humanoid zipped by in a flurry of ever-changing colors, eager to deliver its message.

Irids are said to be born of celestial light filtered through earthly rain. These small manifestations of rainbows bear similarities in appearance and mission to their elevated cousins, but they take little interest in angelic ideals.
**_Mischievous Messengers_**. While angels are known for bringing messages and truth to mortals from the gods, irids prefer to bring gossip and embellished truths. They follow their own ideals of beauty and excitement, disregarding their angelic cousins' insistence on goodness and truth. Irids delight in sneaking around, listening for gossip or revealed secrets, then invisibly whispering exaggerations of in the ears of those who will help spread such gossip.

**_Colorful and Shallow_**. Irids are iridescent, changing the color of the light they shed throughout the day. They are drawn to the brightest colors the world has to offer. To them, evil is synonymous with ugliness, and they resist fighting or hurting anything they find beautiful. This tendency has led more than one irid to fall to the predations and charms of [[Rhopalocerex]] and his minions.
