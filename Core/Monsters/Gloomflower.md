## Description
---
_A tiny flower with shining black petals sways lightly on its thorny stem._

**_Corpse Blooms_**. Gloomflowers are tiny blooms that thrive in the umbral light of the Shadow Realm. When a wanderer dies or goes mad within the darkness, a single gloomflower blooms in the shadow of its corpse. Some shadow fey say that the tortured mind of that creature now inhabits the ebon petals of the gloomflower, the air around the flower humming with its silent screams.
