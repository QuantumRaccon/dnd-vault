## Description
---
>A filthy burial shroud glides silently through the air, the vague features of a humanoid outlined on its cotton surface. The stench of an open grave hangs around it.

**_Suffocating Automatons_**. A death shroud golem is created from the used burial shroud of a humanoid. Most death shroud golems are stained with dirt, blood, or mold, and a few are covered in even more unsavory substances. Despite their appearance, death shroud golems are sturdy constructs and can take quite a beating. A death shroud golem typically strikes from a hidden location, grappling and suffocating its victim.

**_Funerary Constructs_**. Death shroud golems are normally found guarding tombs or other locations where their appearance wouldn't arouse suspicion. Occasionally, necromancers and intelligent undead wear death shroud golems like a cloak or robe, releasing the creature to attack their enemies.

**_Construct Nature_**. A death shroud golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
