## Description
---
_These human-sized parasites resemble ghostly centipedes surrounded in erratic violet radiance. Their flesh is translucent and their jaws are crystalline—they are clearly creatures of strange planes indeed._

**_Destiny Destroyers_**. Fate eaters infest remote areas of the planes, where they consume the threads of Fate itself. The Norns view them as vermin and sometimes engage particularly canny planar travelers either to hunt them or to help repair the damage they have done. This can be a deadly job as the fate eaters consider the destiny of a mortal to be the tastiest of delicacies, rich in savory possibilities.

**_Planar Gossips_**. Fate eaters can and do trade information about various dooms, fates, and outcomes, but one must have something rich in destiny to trade—or at least, juicy gossip about gods and demons.

**_Visionary Flesh_**. Eating the properly-prepared flesh of a fate eater grants insight into the fate of another.
