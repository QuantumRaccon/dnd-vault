## Description
---
_In the autumnal deep forest, the wind stirs fallen leaves into swirling patterns—but some are not what they seem. The whipping winds tear at the skin of hapless travelers before resolving into fierce, weasel-like creatures with long, sickle-shaped claws._

**_Claws to Rip Flesh_**. Appearing as human-sized upright mustelids, these white and blue, furry fey of the deep forest are jealous of mortal intruders and can exact a heavy price from the incautious explorer. The claws on each front foot are extended like curved blades that inflict deep, scything wounds.

**_Wind Riders_**.  Wind weasels have an affinity for the element of air. By running in a tight circle, a wind weasel can generate—and become one with—a swirling vortex of abrasive wind. The weasel uses the whirlwind to surprise and slash at its foes—or to flee if the fight proves unequal.

**_Seasonally Affected_**.  During spring and summer, wind weasels are largely passive and spend most of their time in wind form, drifting lazily around the woodlands. As the leaves and temperatures fall, a wind weasel's mood becomes more vicious, and it actively seeks prey. Though largely beings of the wilds, wind weasels are known to associate with shadow fey and may sometimes be found as guards on the fringes of fey courts or deep woodland groves.
