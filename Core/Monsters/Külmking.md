## Description
---
_This creature's long, horse-like body has far too many legs with multiple arms that end in rending claws, while its misshapen head has a fanged maw used for rending flesh and sucking out souls._

**_Cursed Defiler_**. When a creature chooses to go out of its way to harm forests or other wildlands, fey spirits can curse it to become a külmking. This twisted, horrified undead is forced to become guardian to the lands it once corrupted.

**_Stalker of Fey_**. Though a külmking must follow the wording of its curse to protect the lands to which it is tied, it is a vindictive spirit and will often hunt fey who enter its domain. It delights in terrorizing small sprites and gentle bearfolk alike.

**_Sound of a Thousand Hooves_**. The sound of a külmking's hooves on cobblestones or stony ground often echoes and re-echoes, sounding like a stampede or a much larger company of horses. Occasionally, a pair of külmkings will pull a carriage for vampires, ghouls, or liches.
