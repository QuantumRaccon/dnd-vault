## Description
---
It takes more than a quick blade to lead thieves. The thief lord makes use of considerable personal charm and a keen mind to direct the efforts of its fellows. Most thief lords prefer to keep one foot in law-abiding society and one foot in crime, though which world receives the greater part of their attention varies. Paranoid of assassination attempts by rivals, the thief lord takes minute doses of various poisons daily and has developed resistance to such substances.
