## Description
---
>This long-nosed, fox-like humanoid gestures silently with a smile on its lips and a twinkle in its eyes.

Yaojing find peace traveling the wilds and quietly helping homesteaders and other travelers. They appear to be wiry redheaded men in light clothing. Their features are a mix of human and fox with a long nose, weak chin, and clever eyes.
**_Silent Servitors_**. Before they arrive on the Material Plane, yaojing take a vow of silence. Their vow precludes them from using their telepathy or voice to communicate with mortals. If a yaojing under vow is forced to communicate with more than sign or body language, it must retire to its planar home to live in silent contemplation for 108 years before it can once again travel the Material.

**_Charlatan Haters_**. Yaojing hate nothing so much as those who would use a mortal's faith in the gods against them. When yaojing encounter such shysters in their travels, they work tirelessly to bring the charlatans to justice and remove the blight such creatures represent. Yaojing prefer to turn the charlatans over to local authorities for punishment appropriate to the laws of the land they are traveling, but they take on the role of judge when representatives of the law are absent.

**_Mountain Mystics_**. Some yaojing take up a monastic life. They build shrines on mountaintops where they silently teach their small congregations of adherents the joys of a quiet life of service and contemplation. They also teach their disciples how to avoid being fooled by charlatans and that harmonious societies must be free of such liars.
