## Description
---


> [!INFO] Customizing a Horror
>An unspeakable horror has one of four body compositions, determined by rolling on the Body Composition table. You can roll on the Limbs to customize it further, while results from the Hex Blast table replace that action in the stat block. If the results of multiple tables conflict, chose your preferred result.
>The results of these tables are meant to be broad, so feel free to describe the details of an unspeakable horror's form and the interplay between its parts however you desire. The more discordant and unexpected a horror's parts, the more unsettling it might be.
### Body Composition
---
|d4|Body|
|--|------------|
|1**_Aberrant Armor_**. The horror's body is armored in [[petrified]] wood, alien crystal, rusted mechanisms, sculpted stone, or an exoskeleton.
|
|2**_Loathsome Limbs_**. The horror's body boasts spider like legs, many-jointed appendages, or thrashing tentacles.
|
|3**_Malleable Mass_**. The horror's body is composed of a clot of boneless flesh, shadowy tendrils, or mist.
|
|4**_Oozing Organs_**. The horror's body boasts exposed entrails, bloated parasites, or a gelatinous shroud, perhaps because it is inside out.
|


### Hex Blast
---
|d4|Hex|
|--|------------|
|1**_Beguiling Hex (Recharge 5-6)_**. The horror expels a wave of mind-altering magic. Each creature within 30 feet of the horror must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw, taking 33 (**6d10**) psychic damage and being [[incapacitated]] until the end of the creature's next turn on a failed save, or taking half as much damage on a successful one.
|
|2**_Bile Hex (Recharge 5-6)_**. The horror expels acidic bile in a 60-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or be covered in bile. A creature covered in bile takes 31 (**7d8**) acid damage at the start of each of its turns until it or another creature uses its action to scrape or wash off the bile that covers it.
|
|3**_Petrifying Hex (Recharge 5-6)_**. The horror expels petrifying gas in a 30-foot cone. Each creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage and be [[restrained]] as it begins to turn to stone. A [[restrained]] creature must repeat the saving throw at the end of its next turn. On a success, the effect ends on the target. On a failure, the target is [[petrified]] until freed by the [[greater restoration]] spell or other magic.
|
|4**_Reality-Stealing Hex (Recharge 5-6)_**. The horror expels a wave of perception-distorting energy. Each creature within 30 feet of the horror must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes 22 (**5d8**) psychic damage and is [[deafened]] until the end of its next turn. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the target is also [[blinded]] until the end of its next turn.
|


### Limbs
---
|d4|Attack|
|--|------------|
|1**_Bone Blade_**. The horror's limb ends in a blade made of bone, which deals slashing damage instead of bludgeoning damage. In addition, it scores a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20 and rolls the damage dice of a crit three times, instead of twice.
|
|2**_Corrosive Pseudopod_**. The horror's limb attack deals an extra 9 (**2d8**) acid damage.
|
|3**_Grasping Tentacle_**. The horror's limb is a grasping tentacle. When the horror hits a creature with this limb, the creature is also [[grappled]] (escape DC 16). The limb can have only one creature [[grappled]] at a time.
|
|4**_Poisonous Limb_**. The horror's limb deals piercing damage instead of bludgeoning damage. In addition, when the horror hits a creature with this limb, the creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) poison damage and be [[poisoned]] until the end of its next turn.
