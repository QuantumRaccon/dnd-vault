## Description

>A portly gentleman with slender arms and legs keeps his face and hands carefully concealed.

Arachnocrats are spider-like fiends who enjoy masquerading as members of high society. They eat haute cuisine and drink fine wine in the company of humans.
**_Finer Tastes_**. Viewing the wealth and standing of their victims as the greatest measure of taste, these devils delight in aristocratic prey, though they most often feed on the liquefied innards of servants of the aristocracy to avoid detection. They use local spiders as spies and informants to get closer to their quarries or discover dark secrets their quarries would rather keep hidden. Ever patient in their schemes of corruption, arachnocrats often court their quarries over months of theatre, dinner parties, and elaborate balls.

**_Hidden in Plain Sight_**. Arachnocrats are adept at disguising themselves as aristocrats. Their most noticeable features are their clawed hands and their spider-like faces, which they cover with gloves, masks, scarves, voluminous robes, and similar attire. The eccentricities of the well-to-do help to cast off any suspicion over their odd coverings.

**_As Good As Gold_**. The arachnocrat's preferred prey comes at a high price. Blessed by the Arch-Devil of Greed, [[mammon, archduke of greed \|Mammon]] (Tome of Beasts), arachnocrats have a second stomach that can turn common rocks into faux gemstones. The fiends vomit up the gemstones after digesting the rocks for a few months, and they use the gemstones to fund their endeavors. The counterfeit nature of the gems is detectable by only true craftsmen.
