## Description
---


Geryon can have an action that allows him to summon enslaved minotaurs.

**_Sound the Horn (1/Day)_**. Geryon blows his horn, which causes **5d4** minotaurs to appear in unoccupied spaces of his choice within 600 feet of him. The minotaurs roll initiative when they appear. They remain until they die or Geryon uses an action to dismiss any or all of them.
