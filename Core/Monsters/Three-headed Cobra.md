## Description
---
_This monstrous serpent's body is as thick as a man's torso and covered in ink-black scales. Its trunk branches out to support three hissing heads atop flaring cobra hoods. For all its size, it slithers across the ground almost silently._

Often employed as guardians, the native intelligence of these creatures makes them capable of learning commands.

**_Color Variations_**. The three-headed cobra is most common throughout warm climates, though not unknown on the open plains and in some jungles. While most retain the black coloration found in jungles and hills, other varieties exist. The desert variety often has a pale bone color and skull-like hood pattern; the plains varieties tend toward green or khaki coloration.

**_Golden Guardians_**. The three-headed cobra is a watchful creature associated with guarding shrines and sometimes with rulership over a particular abandoned city or necropolis. Some believe they are protectors of ancient holy relics, sacred scrolls, or divine sparks. Because one of its heads is always awake and alert, it is also favored to guard treasure vaults and counting houses, where large sums of coins are stored. In these cases, the three-headed cobra's scales take on a golden or silvery coloration.

**_Servants of the Queen_**.  The three-headed cobra carries a strong association with the Queen of Serpents (see page 34), who, according to legend, never strays far from their protection (honor guards of at least two and as many as a dozen are common near the Queen). They are thought to be her close companions, and many believe the three-headed cobras serve not only as her bodyguards but also as her consorts.
