## Description
---
_This towering humanoid is shrouded in a heavy cloak darker than night. Color drains from the world as it silently approaches._

An embodiment of the finality of death, a dark father comes for those soon to die. These vultures of the living are attracted to those lingering on the steps to the afterlife and watch over them to hasten their deaths.

**_Funereal Origins_**. Dark fathers frequent graveyards and sepulchers. A dark father may take up a dormant position among the dead, only making itself known when death knocks at a nearby creature's door. Shadows are sometimes drawn to the presence of a dark father.


**_Scales of Death_**. Unlike more bloodthirsty undead, a dark father gives up pursuit if its target receives healing or curative effects that stave off the threat of death. However, it may linger if others are in danger of dying soon. A dark father has no quarrel with healthy creatures and avoids them. However, if attacked while waiting for a dying creature to expire, it will defend itself and even slay the attacker, if necessary.


**_A Shade Apart_**. A dark father may be found among other powerful undead since creatures are more likely to face their mortality when confronting such foes. Just as often, a lone dark father may roam far and wide, finding itself in hospitals, battlefields, and among the houses of the poor and diseased.


**_Undead Nature_**. A dark father doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
