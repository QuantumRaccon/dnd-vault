## Description
---
_A robed figure sits in a pool of deep shadows. The shrouded individual's strained, immobile face and listless hands look abnormal and corpse-like. An unmistakable morbid odor permeates the area, and the air vibrates with a hideous, repressed buzzing. The figure speaks in a hoarse whisper, though his mustache-screened lips remain curiously motionless._

**_Void Regent_**. Sorcerer, emissary, changeling, outsider...the alien entity known as the whisperer in darkness is all of these things and more. This abhorrent master of disguise implements clever and damnable constructions to covertly walk among men. Its naked form is a twisted contortion of grotesque, inhuman features that would surely drive an unsuspecting onlooker mad. The whisperer's artificial face and limbs are the waxen products of an expert artist, but they do little to mask the disturbing timbre of its voice.

**_Tenebrous Physicia_**. The whisperer is a being of prodigious surgical, biological, chemical, and mechanical skill who consorts with nameless things from abysmal space. Among these entities are the vaguely insect-like [[Mi-Go]] (Tome of Beasts, p. 287), who colonize entire worlds in the name of malevolent gods.

**_Mask of Nyarlathotep_**. The whisperer in darkness is one of the many avatars of the Crawling Chaos. This incarnation of the Faceless God is a cosmic abnormality who serves as a manipulative liaison between the mi-go and the native races of the planets they invade.

**_Void Traveler_**. The whisperer in darkness doesn't require air, food, drink, or ambient pressure.
