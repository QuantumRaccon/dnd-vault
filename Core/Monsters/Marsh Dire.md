## Description
---
>This waterlogged humanoid is partially rotting and has plant matter, including a trio of whipping vines, infused in its body.

**_Drowned Dead_**. Marsh dires are the animated remains of humanoids who drowned in marshlands, weighted down by muck and held in place by constricting vines. The bodies decay for several weeks and incorporate the plants that aided in their demise. After they complete this process, they rise as undead, often mistaken as [[zombie \|zombies]]. Their continuously waterlogged state gives them a modicum of protection against fire, and, in dry areas, their footfalls are accompanied by a disquieting squelch.

**_Marsh Rot_**. A marsh dire exudes a persistent odor, combining the smell of rotting flesh and foul marsh gasses. Creatures exposed to the stench must constantly resist nausea. The overwhelming power of the odor prevents the marsh dire from successfully hiding unless it is hidden among other swamp-rotted organic matter.

**_Slow Spawning_**. A marsh dire seeks to kill creatures in the same way it was killed, attacking them from the water, where it can drown them. The vines it uses to hold its struggling victims oozes a vile liquid that rots flesh in a fashion similar to the rot undergone by the marsh dire. When a marsh dire kills a creature, it leaves the body in shallow water, where the body makes the same transformation it once did. Two months later, the body rises as a new marsh dire, independent of the creature that started the process.
Death cults devoted to deities or fiends that champion decay often "seed" nearby swamps with marsh dires by deliberately drowning sacrificial victims. Some cults have learned the hard way that the newly-created marsh dire offers them no loyalty for its creation. Soon, such cults join the marsh dire's ranks to carry out their master's presumed wishes.
