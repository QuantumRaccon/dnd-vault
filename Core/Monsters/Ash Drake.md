## Description
---
_A lean and dull-scaled ash drake often perches on a chimney as if it just crawled out, its tail still hanging into the chimney as smoke billows out._

**_Chimney Nesting_**. Ash drakes clog chimney flues and delight in dusting crowds with thick, choking ash and soot, while the drakes laugh with sneering, wheezing tones. To placate the creatures, owners of smelters and smithies leave large piles of ash for the drakes to play in, with the hope they leave the shop and its workers alone. Anyone hunting ash drakes finds them very difficult to attack in their cramped lairs because the creatures blend in with the surroundings. Ash drakes often befriend kobolds, who have little trouble appeasing the beasts and appreciate the added security they bring.

**_Hunt Strays and Pets_**. Ash drakes eat rats and stray animals, although few can resist snatching an unattended, possibly beloved pet. Contrary to popular opinion, this drake doesn't consume ash, but enjoys a pile of ash like a cat would catnip, rolling around in it and becoming wild-eyed. Anyone who disrupts such play becomes the target of the creature's intensely hot and sooty breath weapon.
While an ash drake is three feet long with a four-foot long tail that seems to trail off into smoke, it weighs less than one might expectâ€”approximately ten lb. Every third winter, when chimneys are active, a male drake leaves his lair to find a mate. If the new couple roosts in a city or town, the nearby streets know it, as the air becomes nearly unbreathable with soot. The resulting eggs are left in a suitable chimney, and one of the parents protects the young until they leave the nest at two years of age.

**_Volcanic Haunts_**. Ash drakes outside a city live in or near volcanic plateaus, and mutter about the lack of neighbors to bully. In the wild, an ash drake may partner with a red dragon or flame dragon, since the dragon provides its lesser cousin with plenty of ash.
