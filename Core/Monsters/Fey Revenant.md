## Description
---
>An amalgam of shadow fey and spider, the thorn-covered fey appears out of the shadows and envelops its victim in icy tendrils of darkness.

**_Will of the Fey Queen_**. Shadow fey who have proven themselves most loyal to the commands and desires of the fey courts catch the eye of the [[Queen of Night and Magic]]. She calls them to her court and blesses them with a measure of her power.

**_Fey Transformation_**. A fey revenant retains the upper torso of its shadow fey body, its skin becomes thorny and bark-like, and its lower body changes into that of an arachnid or insect. Spiders, scorpions, and beetles are the most common, but many fey revenants have lower bodies resembling dragonflies, wasps, and locusts. Fey revenants with insect bodies that can fly have a flying speed of 30 feet.




The [[Moonlit King]] (Tome of Beasts) sometimes creates his own fey revenants. They have the following action option in place of the Queen's Grasp action:

**_King's Fear_**. One creature of the fey revenant's choice within 60 feet of it must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute. While [[frightened]], the creature takes 7 (**2d6**) radiant damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
