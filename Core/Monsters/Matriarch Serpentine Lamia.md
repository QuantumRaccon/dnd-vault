## Description
---
_The pair of serpentine creatures intertwine with the shackled prisoner, their scaly tails and grasping arms squeezing the life from him as he screams silently, the breath choked from his body._

**_The Smaller of the Species_**. Unlike the leonine forms of their larger lamia cousins, the serpentine lamias have humanoid torsos atop a serpentine tail. Seeing themselves as "true" lamia, the serpentine lamia consider the lionâ€‘bodied members of their race "false lamia." They go to great lengths to destroy these false lamia whenever possible.

**_Constant Search for Indulgence_**. Serpentine lamias share the same hedonistic tendencies as their larger namesakes; however, they are more willing to travel or create lairs in civilized areas. In locations, where monstrous species are not attacked on sight as threats, serpentine lamias often travel freely without disguise. Their love of the finer things in life offers them opportunities to act as merchants, curators, and art experts. Their barely controlled desires often leave them unhindered by conscience or scruple, affording them careers of a more criminal nature.

**_Worship the Moon_**. Something in the serpentine lamias' psyches gives them a strong connection to the moon. They are at their most calm and rational when the moon is new, but as the lunar cycle moves toward its peak, the urges for debauchery and hedonism grow in the serpentine lamia. "During a full moon in a lamia's lair" has become a colloquial saying for a time or place of inescapable danger. For the duration of a full moon, serpentine lamias congregate at the home of the most prestigious of their kind. The bacchanalia that take place at these gatherings are legendary, where the overconsumption of the finest food and drink is only the beginning. In places with less stringent moral and ethical codes, the murder of innocents is often the highlight of these evenings.
