## Description
---
>At the core of its clockwork armor, the creature is a shapeless horror from beyond the stars.

Weak and easy prey in their natural state, the ahu-nixta long ago mastered the art of clockwork design, building armor that could carry them through the voids between stars and bolster their physical abilities. After mastering clockwork design, the ahu-nixta turned to enhancing themselves to better utilize greater and greater clockwork creations.
**_Evolved Terrors_**. As ahu-nixta age and prove themselves against their people's enemies, they are forcibly evolved in eugenic chambers and given new armor. The ahu-nixta are comprised of drudges, rank-and-file [[ahu-nixta]] (Creature Codex) and cataphracts. The drudges are the least evolved and lowest form of ahu-nixta, evolving into standard citizens after years of meeting rigorous physical and mental demands from their superiors.

**_Boundless Potential_**. The bodies of ahu-nixta are highly responsive to forced evolution, leaving the creatures with seemingly endless potential for advancement. Scholars speculate that undiscovered stages of ahu-nixta evolution exist, hidden by the leaders of the ahu-nixta until called upon to serve the wishes of their evil gods.
