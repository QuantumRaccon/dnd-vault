## Description
---
_A bipedal caribou adorned with spiked horns stalks the edge of the forest. Its melodious voice calls to hunters, telling them of clean springs, a fine honeycomb, and easy prey just a little further ahead._

While their true forms are invisible to most, ijiraq are often seen wandering the wilds in the form of beasts or terrible caribouhuman hybrids. If seen in their true forms, they resemble short humans with horrifying features.

**_Hunters of Man_**. Ijiraq are known to abduct humans to use for sport. Many will carry skulls of their kills as trophies, and they have a fondness for the taste of human meat. At times, they do pretend to be guides to some hidden shrine or a flock of fat geese, to lure a hunter away from others. However, they view it as poor form to attack humans that come to speak with them and will treat such people with respect during a moot.


**_Loathing of the Sea_**. The ijiraq detest open waters, the creatures that live within them, and goods that come from them. Many villages have found safety from ijiraq by relocating close to the water's edge.
