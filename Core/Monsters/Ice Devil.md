## Description
---


Some ice devils have the following action options.

**_Multiattack_**. The devil makes two attacks: one with its spear and one with its tail.
**_Ice Spear_**.  **10** to hit, reach 10 ft., one target. {@h}14 (**2d8 + 5**) piercing damage plus 10 (**3d6**) cold damage. If the target is a creature, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, or for 1 minute, its speed is reduced by 10 feet; it can take either an action or a bonus action on each of its turns, not both; and it can't take reactions. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.
