## Description
---
>This horrid creature is larger than an ox, and its hairless, wrinkled skin is covered in foul warts and pustules. The creature has two rat-like heads and a heavy tentacular tail that lashes the air malevolently.

**_Wasteland Monstrosity_**. The galidroo dwells primarily in desolate badlands, ravaged ruins, and areas where magic has corrupted the landscape and the creatures within it. Though powerful monsters in their own right, they are rarely at the top of the food chain and have to watch out for other monsters like [[purple worm \|purple worms]] and [[ancient wasteland dragon \|wasteland dragons]] (Creature Codex).

**_Prophetic Beasts_**. The galidroo's two heads can see into the past, present, and future simultaneously, giving them a distorted, almost fatalistic view on life. Since the galidroo cannot see its own past or future, it is filled with endless frustration, and it zealously unleashes its rage upon anyone unfortunate enough to cross its path. Powerful liches frequently enslave galidroos, forcing the creatures to use their prophetic talents to serve the liches' plans. Because of the poor treatment they usually receive, galidroos are quick to turn on their "masters."
