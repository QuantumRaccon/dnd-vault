## Description
---
_This proud bird struts like a peacock, made all the more majestic by its flaming fan of feathers, which shift through the color spectrum._

**_Guides and Helpers_**. Firebirds are welcome sights to those in need of warmth and safety. They primarily work at night or in underground areas, where their abilities are most needed. Friendly to all creatures, they become aggressive only upon witnessing obviously evil acts.
Firebirds enjoy working with good adventuring parties, providing light and healing, though their wanderlust prevents them from staying for long. Well-traveled parties may encounter the same firebird more than once, however.

**_Redeemers_**. Firebirds enjoy acting as reformers. They find mercenary creatures they perceive as potential "light bringers" to whom they grant boons in exchange for a geas to perform a specific good deed, in the hope such acts will redeem them.

**_Magical Feathers_**. Firebird feathers are prized throughout the mortal world; occasionally, the creatures bestow feathers upon those they favor. Firebirds also seed hidden locations with specialized feathers, which burst into full-grown firebirds after a year. As the creatures age, their feathers' light dims, but this occurs gradually, as the creatures live over 100 years. Firebirds stand three feet tall and weigh 20 lb.
