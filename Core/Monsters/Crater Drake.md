## Description
---
>Flecks of unnatural luminescence dot the hide of this small dragon. Plants slowly wilt in its shadow, and even insects give it a wide berth.

Crater drakes live in inhospitable badlands and thrive in areas where hostile magic lingers.
**_Decaying Presence_**. The presence of a crater drake has a profoundly negative impact on its environment. Stunted or dead vegetation and pools of toxic water surround a crater drake's lair.

**_Prone to Mutation_**. The twisted magic of their homelands infuses the crater drakes, promoting diversity in the species. Two drakes, even those hatched from the same clutch, rarely have identical biology. They continue to mutate as they age, and it isn't unusual for a crater drake to develop new abilities through these mutations.

**_Treasure Eaters_**. Crater drakes keep their treasure hoards in the safest place they know: their gullets. Opening the stomach of a dead crater drake reveals fused piles of metals studded with precious gems and the occasional magical trinket.

**_Survivor_**. The crater drake doesn't require food or water.


> [!INFO] Crater Drake Mutations
>Mutation is common among crater drakes. If you want to make a crater drake that is unique from typical crater drakes, roll a **d6** or choose a mutation from the following:
**_Tail Sweep_**.  **9** to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. {@h}9 (**1d8 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be knocked [[prone]]. The drake can use this in place of one claw attack when using its Multiattack action.

**_Immunity to Acid_**. The drake has immunity, rather than resistance, to acid damage.

**_Steel Hide_**. The drake's hide is tougher than most drakes. Its Armor Class increases by 2.

**_Caustic Bite_**. Instead of poison damage, the drake's bite deals an extra 17 (**5d6**) acid damage.

**_Burrower_**. The drake's wings are stunted and useless. It doesn't have a flying speed, but it has a burrowing speed of 30 feet.

**_Survivor's Fortitude_**. If damage reduces the drake to 0 hp, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken. On a success, the drake drops to 1 hp instead.
