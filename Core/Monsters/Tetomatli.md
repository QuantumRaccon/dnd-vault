## Description
---
>This lumbering basalt construct has the body of a great ape and the wings of a bat instead of arms. Its head ends in a wide stone mallet without a mouth, eyes, or nose. It taps its hammer-like head on the ground with an echoing thwack.

**_Demon-forged Guardians_**. Tetomatlis are constructs created by the followers of the demon lord [[mechuiti, demon lord of apes \|Mechuiti]] (Tome of Beasts) to guard their most important shrines and temples. Tetomatli creation involves the sacrifice of multiple humans or apes, and they are tainted by chaos and evil as a result. Tetomatlis are bloodthirsty guardians and enjoy crushing victims into a bloody paste. Since they first appeared, the secret of creating tetomatlis has spread to other demon cults and evil golem makers, allowing the creatures to slowly spread in number.

**_Blind Behemoths_**. Tetomatlis are blind and deaf but can magically sense their surroundings by tapping their heads rapidly on the ground. Foiling the senses of a tetomatli is a difficult proposition, but the chaotic nature of the construct means that it can sometimes be tricked into leaving its post or stumbling into dangerous situations.

**_Construct Nature_**. A tetomatli doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
