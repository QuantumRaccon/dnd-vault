## Description
---
_A brutish forest-dwelling giant whose loathing for fey creatures is matched only by its love of power. It is a tall muscled humanoid with bark-like skin that wears animal skins and adorns itself with the skulls of its fey victims._

**_Imprisoner_**. Chuhaister detest fey creatures of any alignment, taking delight in capturing them and destroying their villages. Many chuhaister carry an unfortunate fey as a pet, which they keep in a wooden cage atop their heads. The giant's nullifying magic prevents the creature from using its spells to escape.


**_Chieftains_**. Chuhaister sometimes lead small clans of [[Forest Marauder \|forest marauders]] (Tome of Beasts), serving as chieftain to the dim-witted giants. In this role, they organize raids on fey communities within their territory and terrorize other settlements near their border. As chieftain, the chuhaister uses its clan to build great wooden fortifications in the deep recesses of the forest.
