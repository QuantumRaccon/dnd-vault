> [!INFO] Customizing Dragons
>You can customize any dragon's stat block to reflect the dragon's unique character. Minor changes such as those below are easy to make and have no impact on a dragon's challenge rating.
**_Languages_**. Most dragons prefer to speak Draconic but learn Common for dealing with allies and minions. But given their high Intelligence and long life span, dragons can easily learn additional languages. You can add languages to a dragon's stat block.

**_Skills_**. Most dragons are proficient in the [[Perception]] and [[Stealth]] skills, and many dragons have additional skill proficiencies. As with languages, you can customize a dragon's skill list (even doubling their proficiency bonus with certain skills) to reflect particular interests and activities. You can also give a dragon tool proficiencies, particularly if the dragon spends time in Humanoid form.

**_Spells_**. _See the "Variant: Dragons as Innate Spellcasters" inset(s), below._

**_Other Traits and Actions_**. You can borrow traits and actions from other monsters to add unique flavor to a dragon. Consider these examples:
- **Change Shape**: You can decide that a dragon acquires this action at a younger age than usual, particularly if you want to feature a dragon in Humanoid form in your campaign:The dragon magically polymorphs into a humanoid or beast that has a challenge rating no higher than its own, or back into its true form. It reverts to its true form if it dies. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying is absorbed or borne by the new form (the dragon's choice).In a new form, the dragon retains its alignment, hit points, Hit Dice, ability to speak, proficiencies, Legendary Resistance, lair actions, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores, as well as this action. Its statistics and capabilities are otherwise replaced by those of the new form, except any class features or legendary actions of that form.
- **Flyby**: The dragon is an agile flier, quick to fly out of enemies' reach.The dragon doesn't provoke an opportunity attack when it flies out of an enemy's reach.
- **Mimicry**: Impersonating characters or their allies could be a fun trick for a crafty dragon.The dragon can mimic any sounds it has heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds can tell they are imitations with a successful DC 19 Wisdom ([[Insight]]) check.
- **Rejuvenation**: You might decide that dragons in your campaign, being an essential part of the Material Plane, are nearly impossible to destroy. A dragon's life essence might be preserved in the egg from which it first emerged, in its hoard, or in a cavernous hall at the center of the world, just as a lich's essence is hidden in a phylactery.If it has an essence-preserving object, a destroyed dragon gains a new body in **1d10** days, regaining all its hit points and becoming active again. The new body appears within 5 feet of the object.
- **Special Senses**: Most dragons have [[blindsight]] and [[darkvision]]. You might upgrade [[blindsight]] to [[truesight]], or you could give a dragon with a burrowing speed [[tremorsense]].
