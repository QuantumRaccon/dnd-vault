## Description
---
_These ancient creatures resemble nothing so much as black cats dressed in sumptuous, if archaic, clothing._

**_Xenophobic_**. The nichny are highly xenophobic and gleefully carnivorous fey who dwell in deep, primeval forests.

**_True and False Prophets_**. They can dispense luck to those they like and they certainly have oracular powers, but they rarely share their prophecies with outsiders. Their prophecies are always delivered in triples, and legend holds that two inevitably prove true and one proves false.

**_Answer Three Questions_**. One final legend claims that if a nichny can be bound with gold or orichalcum chains, it must answer three questions. As with their prophecies, two answers will be true and one will be a lie. All three questions must be posed before any will be answered. When the third answer is given, the nichny and the chains disappear.

> [!INFO] Nichny in Midgard
>Known as dolia ("fate speakers") in Old Elvish, elven legend says the nichny welcomed the first elves to Midgard, as if they had been present since its creation. They also gifted the first Emperor of the Elves with three prophecies: humans would cause a great schism and estrangement among the elves, and force them to flee Midgard; an elfmarked child would be the doom of all elvenkind; and a third prophecy so horrific that the elves erased it with powerful magic.
>Even with their most puissant divination spells, the mages of Bemmea cannot determine the nature of the final prophecy. Because one will prove untrue, the elves' precautions may be unnecessary, but many would dearly like to know what the elves are so terrified of.
