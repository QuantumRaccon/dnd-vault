## Description
---
The only creatures more vile than demons—creatures born irredeemably evil—are those who willingly adopt a demon's cruel ways. Worst among the demon worshipers are the fallen paladins known as doomspeakers, warriors so ensorcelled by power that they would burn the world just to rule its ashes. These creatures walk the path of evil not by birth but by choice, and they breed cruelty in their hearts so dark that no glimmer of compassion can pierce it. Doomspeakers raise vast hordes of weak-minded and rage-fueled followers to run roughshod over the world. Empowered by their leader's evil magic, such legions can trample even mighty armies into the mud.
