## Description
---
>Flurries drift from the body of this gigantic humanoid seemingly crafted from snow. Its simple clothes are almost pointless, and it carries a massive icicle as a club.

**_Subservient to Frost Giants_**. Snow giants inhabit the same territory as [[frost giant \|frost giants]], but they are considerably smaller than their more aggressive kin. Snow giants offer themselves up as servants to frost giants, most likely as a survival mechanism. The larger giants often employ snow giants as menial domestic servants, forcing them to clean lairs or craft armor and weapons. Frost giants view snow giants as incompetent at waging war, but they send the lesser giants as a vanguard against foes they suspect will prove tougher than their own numbers can handle. The bigger giants also use snow giants as proxies to settle clan disputes or questions of leadership.
Despite the bullying and maltreatment they receive from frost giants, snow giants rarely consider rebelling against their more powerful cousins. They often take the long view that their lives would be worse without the frost giants' protection.

**_Inherently Playful Beings_**. If snow giants had their druthers and managed to avoid sharing space with frost giants, they would be more concerned with enjoying the wintry landscape they inhabit. When not driven by frost giants or by the need to acquire food, snow giants are mirthful and enjoy getting into snowball fights with those they encounter. Among themselves, these snowball fights are akin to children playing in the snow. They are unaware of their own strength when engaging in such activity with smaller beings. The giants quickly realize the harm they inflict, and, provided they don't receive armed retaliation for the accidental injuries they cause, they apologize and revert to using considerably smaller and less impactful snowballs.

**_Snowy Flesh_**. As most giants are at least touched by primal elements, so too are snow giants partially composed of the element of water, at least in its frozen form. While this offers them considerably less protection than a stone giant's granite flesh, their connection to snow allows them to heal themselves merely by applying a patch of snow to an injury. Packing on snow also allows the snow giants to hide themselves more effectively, which becomes useful when they attempt to avoid the notice of brutal frost giants.
