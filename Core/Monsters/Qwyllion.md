## Description
---
_These hideous, reeking creatures resemble toothless, cadaverous hags, their large eyes glowing with unearthly green light, and their fingers tipped with ragged claws._

**_Twisted Nymphs_**. Qwyllion (the name means "polluter" in Old Elvish) are nymphs who have been twisted by the corrupted mana of magical wastelands or warped alchemical experiments into baleful versions of their former selves.

**_Frighten Animals_**. Besides making them hideously ugly, the transformation leaves them with a deadly gaze attack and the ability to dominate a living creature with a mere glance. Animals refuse to approach within 20 feet of them.

**_Goblin Mercenaries_**. Qwyllion and their dominated thralls and enslaved specters are sometimes engaged by goblin sorcerers and evil mages to guard desecrated temples and despoiled gardens. The terms and payments for these arrangements vary wildly from one qwyllion to the next. Anyone who dares to employ a qwyllion must be constantly vigilant, because these creatures are prone to renege on any agreement eventually.
