## Description
---
>A pale yellow and green slug-like creature with a benign expression on its round human face sits atop a large mushroom. Long antennae wave atop its bald head as its languid blue eyes observe its surroundings.

**_Fairytale Fey_**. A fragrant one is a whimsical and playful creature whose innocent and friendly demeanor hides a cunning intelligence. Fragrant ones feed on companionship and use their magical pheromones to inveigle themselves into the lives of other creatures, particularly woodland humanoids and giants. Strangely, a fragrant one knows nothing of real commitment or friendship, and all of its relationships are built on lies and deceptions.

**_Safety in Numbers_**. Fragrant ones are relatively weak when alone, barely having enough strength to fend off predators. When in the presence of multiple charmed companions, however, a fragrant one becomes much more of a threat, its body growing thick chitinous plates and its antennae lengthening.
