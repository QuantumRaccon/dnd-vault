## Description
---
_Coiling like a living corkscrew, moving with a scraping hiss, a lindwurm's serpentine form skates nimbly across ice on long curving claws, maw agape and stinking of a hundred graves._

**_Swift and Smooth as Ice_**. Lindwurms have long bodies and crocodilian jaws, but they skitter overland on spindly limbs. Their talons are long and curved, acting as skates or short skis when moving over ice. Few things are swifter on the ice.

**_Sea Hunters_**. In the wild, lindwurms hunt in groups, looking for breaching whales, seals, or incautious fishermen. They employ wolf-pack tactics and enjoy surprising foes. With their considerable cunning, they may skate by their prey at speed, snapping a bite as they pass or snatching them up with their constricting tails.
