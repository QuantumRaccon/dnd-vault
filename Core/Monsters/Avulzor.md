## Description
---
>A horrid-looking bipedal creature with cracked, leathery skin and long arms and legs—ending in wicked, flensing talons—rears up. A trio of unblinking purple eyes is situated in the monster's chest, and its neck ends in a nest of lamprey-like heads. It wears a kilt of humanoid bones that rattles unnervingly as it moves.

**_Horrors from Beyond Reality_**. Avulzors are hideous aberrations native to a dimension inundated with necrotic energy. There they weave plans for dominating the other planes of existence, launching expeditionary forces into other worlds to kidnap humanoids for experimentation, steal useful magical devices, or destroy perceived threats. Their reasons for doing so are largely unknown, yet they despise all other living creatures.

**_Masters of Bone_**. While avulzors hate all life, they have a disturbingly accurate understanding of humanoid anatomy and use this knowledge to grant their undead constructs extra power. They can also shape bone as if it were putty, transforming an ogre's pelvis into a usable chair or a dwarf's teeth and ribs into a complex musical instrument. While they find undead creatures like skeletons and zombies useful tools, they have no real love for intelligent undead, such as wights and vampires, and only tolerate the creatures when necessary to further their own goals.
