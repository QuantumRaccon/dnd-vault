## Description
---
_This titanic worm's rocky hide is rough and hard as stone. Its yawning gullet writhes with miniature worms like itself._

**_Elemental Predators_**. Sathaq worms are nightmarish predators from the Plane of Elemental Earth, 30 feet long and 10 feet thick, with rugged brown hide embedded with stones. They devour stone and flesh with equal ease.

**_Guts Filled with Larvae_**. Sathaq worms are solitary; they approach each other only to mate. Their young incubate inside the worms' gullets. Creatures they swallow are simultaneously digested by the parent worm and devoured by the larvae.

**_Painful Presence_**. Ultrasonic noise and magical ripples that tear at flesh and bone make the very presence of a sathaq worm extremely uncomfortable for creatures of the Material Plane.
