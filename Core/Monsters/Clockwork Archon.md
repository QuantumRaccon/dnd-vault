## Description
---
>The air around this massive construct is filled with the sound of spinning gears and mechanisms. It spreads its metal wings and takes to the air in a roar of wind.

**_Servants of the Righteous_**. Clockwork archons are built to fight in the names of deities devoted to justice, battle, and glory. They stand as bulwarks upon the battlefields of the holy, offering a rallying point for paladins and crusaders. Churches that have the ability to manufacture clockwork archons guard the knowledge jealously, lest it fall into the hands of the unworthy.

**_Engines of War_**. Clockwork archons are deployed as support vehicles and weapons. A single archon can quickly reduce a small settlement's defenses to ruin, while groups of them can swiftly render fortified structures to rubble. Armies with clockwork archons at their disposal sometimes use them to move sensitive material and personnel into position.

**_Corruptible Constructs_**. On occasion, a clockwork archon is captured by the enemy. The followers of some evil gods, archdevils, and demon lords have determined methods of overwriting the construct's animating magic, turning the creature to their fell purposes. More than one community has had its cheer turn to dismay as the clockwork archon they freely allowed inside the walls disgorged enemy agents while attacking the structures and residents. More insidious cults use their clockwork archons to mask their true natures. They allow the common folk to believe they represent good faiths while they rot the community's moral fabric from the inside.

**_Construct Nature_**. A clockwork archon doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
