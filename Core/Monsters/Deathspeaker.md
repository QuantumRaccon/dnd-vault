## Description
---
>An ancient man in a tattered cloak with matted hair, cloudy eyes, and a deathly pallor says in a raspy voice, "Come, sit, and listen."

**_Doomsayer_**. The deathspeaker appears to be alive, if only barely, but it is an undead menace that attempts to engage people in conversation, eventually cursing the one who listens to it by predicting the listener's death. The deathspeaker claims to be a seer who is granted glimpses into the future, saying it is there to advise people of the perils they face. Deathspeakers know their appearance can often be unsettling to humanoids, and many use disguises or heavy clothing to obscure their features.

**_Evil Origins_**. Deathspeakers are imparted unlife from gods of trickery and deception. Chosen from people who were charlatans in life, deathspeakers rely on their former tricks to curse the living in the names of their gods.

**_Cadaver Sprites_**. For reasons that aren't understood, [[cadaver sprite \|cadaver sprites]] are often found in areas around deathspeakers, though not always in their company. Deathspeakers are neither fey nor associated with the fey courts, but they don't dissuade the little undead from following them. Even the most learned sages don't understand why the two associate with each other, though some speculate it lies in their shared penchant for trickery.

**_Undead Nature_**. The deathspeaker doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
