## Description
---
In some locations, the walls between the worlds of the living and the dead are thin. For the inhabitants of these areas, it is more important than ever to perform proper burial rites, for the smallest mistake could give rise to a [[guiguai]].
**_Lifelike Appearance_**. If a guiguai does not look a living creature in the eye, it is indistinguishable from how it appeared in life. Once the ghost's gaze meets a living creature's gaze, its ghostly nature becomes apparent.

**_Sins of Life_**. While most ghosts result from the improper burial of a body, guiguai arise due to funeral rites that do not properly atone for the dead individual's unique sins in life. Restitution to the gods must be made to negate the weight of a person's sins pulling them back to the world of the living.

**_Undead Nature_**. The guiguai doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


**_Manifestation_**. Each guiguai manifests in a way unique to the sinful life it led before it died.
**_Bagui, Drought Ghost_**. This manifestation occurs in humanoids who lived lives filled with greed, lust, and gluttony. In death, they seek to scour that which they once consumed with their scorching wind.

**_Xiqigui, Spelleating Ghost_**. This manifestation occurs in humanoids whose lives were consumed with the search for arcane power. In death, their appetite continues, compelling them to seek out and consume spell energy.
