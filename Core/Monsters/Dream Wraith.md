## Description
---
_This wraith creature hovers over its sleeping victim, its ghostly silver hand reaching down toward her throat. The wraith changes form, appearing as the lost love of the sleeper. As the sleeper opens her eyes and smiles at the sight, the wraith wraps its cold fingers around the woman's throat and squeezes._

**_Haunter of Dreams_**. The dream wraith is an undead monster spawned when a living creature is killed while in the throes of a powerful dream. That dream wraith then wanders the world, searching out others having powerful dreams, hoping to finish its own unfinished dream and find peace in oblivion.


**_Dwellers in the Dream World_**. Born from the world of dreams, the dream wraiths live partially in the mortal world and partially in the land of dreams. As such, it is particularly vulnerable to those who can mete out psychic damage.


**_Sleeping Victims_**. While dream wraiths are rare, even a solitary wraith can devastate a densely populated area. They tend to focus on one victim at a time, stealing into bed chambers and bunkrooms at night while everyone sleeps. They move through walls without waking sleepers, sense the person having the most vivid dream, and drain its life force via its dreams. Sometimes the victim survives the attack, waking in the morning feeling very ill, but often the shock of the attack kills the dreamer. The creature's body remains, but its spirit follows the dream wraith into the night, becoming a servant of the creature.


**_Undead Nature_**. The dream wraith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
