## Description
---
_Covered with an iridescent sheen and able to pursue prey on land and water, a purple slime's needlelike spikes seem to be constantly in motion, changing its shape and even its hue to get closer to prey._

**_Aquatic Lurkers_**. The purple slime lives and hunts in shallow waters such as ponds, tide pools, abandoned animal troughs, and stagnant, flooded areas, where it is nearly invisible. The creature spreads itself out in such a place and waits for prey to approach.

**_Necrotizing Enzymes_**. When it detects a nearby creature, it forms long, hollow, conical spikes from its amorphous body which jut out toward the intended prey. Once these spikes pierce its target, it injects a necrotic fluid which dissolves muscle tissue.

**_Patient Hunters_**. Once a creature is killed or disabled, either by its spikes or its dissolving fluid, the slime undulates forward and covers the creature, devouring it entirely before returning to its previous hiding place.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A purple slime doesn't require sleep.
