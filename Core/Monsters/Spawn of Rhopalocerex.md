## Description
---
>This large demon is bright orange and yellow, with black markings on its face and wiry body. Its wings are rounded, and its face is insectoid, with large, glowing, red eyes. Black liquid drips from its sharp mandibles. Its long arms end in sharp claws.

**_Everywhere Rhopalocerex Needs to Be_**. The spawn of Rhopalocerex can be found near [[Rhopalocerex]] or in areas where the demon lord has some sort of vested interest. They serve as his direct agents, whether he is trying to establish alliances or going to war against some individual or group.

**_Lords of Butterflies and Moths_**. Like the demon lord himself, the spawn of Rhopalocerex enjoy a special kinship with moths and butterflies. Moths and butterflies regularly accompany the spawn, aiding them whenever possible.

**_Wardens of the Abyss_**. The spawn of Rhopalocerex are the wardens of the deadly wild areas of the Abyss under Rhopalocerex's control, defending it against all who would come to defile it. They originate at the demon lord's lair in the great tree and fly beneath its wide boughs, looking for threats or awaiting missions to other planes.
