## Description
---
_This giant appears dead-eyed and sullen, trudging along as if the weight of the entire world rests on his shoulders. Three huge ghostly figures swirl around the giant who looks at them with a mixture of fear and loathing._

By adolescence, some male hill and stone giants are plagued by the spirits of their ancestors. The ghosts' incessant whispers drive them off alone or in small familial groups to lay their ancestors' remains to rest. This can consume their lives to the extent that even breeding isn't a priority, so the giants' own ancestors drive their race toward extinction. The more who die, the more ghosts return to burden the living, leading many tribes to cremate their deadâ€”though this is considered a vile act of desecration by many giants.

**_Anchored to Descendants_**. This ghostly harassment manifests itself as an ancestral spirit. These spirits are anchored to the souls of their descendants and appear near their host either as dark, flickering shades or as looming, spectral apparitions. The giant will take steps to defend its ancestral spirits if they are attacked but will likely be glad at the temporary respite if the spirits are driven off.


**_Permanent Haunting_**. Spirits return to plague their briefly relieved descendants at the rate of one spirit per hour. The spirits cannot be destroyed permanently unless their bones are found and laid to rest.
