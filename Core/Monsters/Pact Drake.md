## Description
---
_The thief pushed a clinking bag across the desk, but the pact drake hissed and spit, making it clear that the law could not be bent, even for a handsome price._

The word of law in draconic form, pact drakes make their homes in large cities or other seats of authority. They often appear at major negotiations, as if drawn by an uncanny sense. Sometimes welcomed, sometimes not, the drakes nevertheless assure that all parties honor the contract.

**_Witnesses for a Price_**. Some nations or powerful individuals retain the services of a pact drake, usually by providing historical, legal, or religious documents. Some of these creatures also demand trivial payment in gems and jewels; though trivial to the drake could mean up to 10% of the kingdom's treasure. Delicate negotiations between rival humanoid powers sometimes fall to the pact drakes "employed" by both sides.


**_Crowns, Seals, and Banners_**. As the embodiment of law, a pact drake must enforce all deals it brokers. While its 4-foot long body and 1-foot long tail make a pact drake seem insignificant, it carries an unmistakable presence in the halls of power. The creatures sometimes take on affectations to further their image, usually the trappings of authority recognized by the society around them, such as particular flags, rings, seals, or umbrellas carried by servants.
