## Description
---
>A quivering glob wraps around a corpse's arm. Though the corpse is already decaying, the glob seems to accelerate the rot.

**_Expediter of Decay_**. The rotsam feeds on rotting flesh, encouraging decay in already rotten corpses and initiating decay in previously preserved corpses. Unfortunately, the rotsam can affect living tissue just as well and makes no distinction between the two.

**_Leechlike Underwater Dwellers_**. Rotsams attach to their prey like leeches, but they are considerably more difficult to remove than ordinary leeches.

**_Favored of Rot Cults_**. Cultists devoted to deities of disease, death, and decay "raise" rotsams for use in their sacrificial rituals.

**_Ooze Nature_**. A rotsam doesn't require sleep.
