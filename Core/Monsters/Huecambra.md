## Description
---
>The squat newt's body is dappled gray and chocolate-brown and covered in colorful, wart-like gems, most prominently over its back and along its thick tail. It has long claws, a mouth full of needle-like fangs, and a gleam of intelligence in its multifaceted amber eyes.

**_Mysterious Jungle Hunters_**. The huecambra is an unusual and rarely seen predator native to tropical jungles and swamps. It hides amid tall reeds or in murky stretches of water, covering itself in mud to hide the gleam of the gem-like growths covering its body. Basilisks, crocodiles, and venomous snakes are the favored prey of a huecambra, though it eats just about anything it can catch. While the true origin of the huecambra remains a mystery, the people of the jungles and swamps where the monster lives believe the creature to be born from the soul of a person overcome with greed and vanity.

**_Gems with Teeth_**. The huecambra is often hunted for its gem-like growths, which are useful in constructing magic items that protect their wearers from petrification and poison. The luster of the gems also inspires humanoids to hunt them, and brooches and necklaces of huecambra gems are popular items among the social elite of certain countries and city-states.
