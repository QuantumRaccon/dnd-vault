## Description
---
_These warrior women, armed with cruel-looking swords, sit astride massive winged wolves. Each of them is as beautiful, graceful, and fierce as a well-honed war ax._

**_Choosers of the Slain._**. Valkyries are sent by Odin to decide the course of battles and harvest the souls of brave fallen warriors. Riding savage winged wolves ([[winter wolf \|winter wolves]] with a fly speed of 80 feet), they visit battlefields to do their master's will, surrounded by crows and ravens. Valkyries remain invisible during these missions, dispensing [[bane]] or [[bless]] spells as fate decrees.

**_Despise Humanoids_**. They love animals, especially birds, but are scornful of humanoids as weak and cowardly. All valkyries love battle and bloodshed, and many are savage and callous.

**_Neutral Parties_**. Valkyries seldom interfere in mortal affairs, save to ensure the proper course of battles. Upon occasion when duty demands, or sometimes as a punishment or, rarely, when they fall in love, a valkyrie may wander the mortal world.
