## Description
---


Myconids that embrace [[Zuggtmoy]] can develop new, more destructive kinds of spores. Myconid sovereigns have all these spore effects.

**_Caustic Spores (1/Day)_**. The myconid releases spores in a 30-foot cone. Each creature inside the cone must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or take 3 (**1d6**) acid damage at the start of each of the myconid's turns. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of its turn, ending the effect on itself on a success. The save DC is 8 + the myconid's Constitution modifier + the myconid's proficiency bonus.
**_Infestation Spores (1/Day)_**. The myconid releases spores that burst out in a cloud that fills a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on it, and the cloud lingers for 1 minute. Any flesh-and-blood creature in the cloud when it appears, or that enters it later, must make a DC 12 Constitution saving throw. The save DC is 8 + the myconid's Constitution modifier + the myconid's proficiency bonus. On a successful save, the creature can't be infected by these spores for 24 hours. On a failed save, the creature is infected with a disease called the spores of Zuggtmoy) and also gains a random form of indefinite madness (determined by rolling on the Madness of [[Zuggtmoy]] table) that lasts until the creature is cured of the disease or dies. While infected in this way, the creature can't be reinfected, and it must repeat the saving throw at the end of every 24 hours, ending the infection on a success. On a failure, the infected creature's body is slowly taken over by fungal growth, and after three such failed saves, the creature dies and is reanimated as a spore servant if it's a humanoid or a Large or smaller beast.
**_Euphoria Spores (1/Day)_**. The myconid releases a cloud of spores in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on itself. Other creatures in that area must each succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The save DC is 8 + the myconid's Constitution modifier + the myconid's proficiency bonus. A creature can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect early on itself on a success. When the effect ends on it, the creature gains one level of [[exhaustion]].
