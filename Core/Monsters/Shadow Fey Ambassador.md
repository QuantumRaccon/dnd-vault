## Description
---
_Stylishly dressed, this beautiful fey has alabaster-white skin, pointed ears, and a small pair of curved horns. Her face displays a cruel and cunning smile as she reads from a long parchment covered in elvish writing—a treaty full of devious sub-clauses and near‑unreadable small lettering._

When fey lords and ladies need to treat with mortals on matters of interest, they will often dispatch a shadow fey ambassador to negotiate on their behalf. These silver-tongued ambassadors are diplomats par excellence, capable of blending charm, bribery, and sheer menace to get what they want.

**_Hidden Embassies_**. When it arrives into a city, the shadow fey ambassador will first choose a disused building to establish its base of operations. This embassy is usually well hidden with few individuals entrusted with its location. Shadow fey ambassadors staff their embassy with plenty of minions, including other shadow fey, [[Shadow Goblin \|shadow goblins]], and [[Hound of the Night \|hounds of the night]] (Tome of Beasts). Many ambassadors have a [[shadow fey guardian]] as a personal bodyguard.


**_Haughty Proclamations_**. Once established, a shadow fey ambassador will inveigle itself into the local circles of power, then issue a proclamation outlining the wishes of the fey lord or lady to the mortal rulers. They will set out the many benefits of enthusiastic cooperation with these demands and the dire consequences of failing to comply. The unscrupulous shadow fey then respond as necessary with hefty bribes, intimidation, or assassination to bring recalcitrant mortals around to their way of thinking.
