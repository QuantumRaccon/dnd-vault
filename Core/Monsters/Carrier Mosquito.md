## Description
---
Carrier mosquitos are massive insects that defy logic, as they not only stay aloft but also zip around with incredible speed and maneuverability. Their nine-foot wingspans keep them from falling out of the sky, but their wings beat frequently, producing an incredibly loud and distracting drone. Swamp-dwelling [[cueyatl]] (Creature Codex) train carrier mosquitos and use them as mounts. When not using the mosquitos on a hunt, cueyatl riders compete in jousting matches, most of which end with a cueyatl yielding before its mosquito becomes seriously injured to avoid jeopardizing future hunts.
