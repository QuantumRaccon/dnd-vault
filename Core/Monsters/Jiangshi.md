## Description
---
_Its sickly-green, glowing skin covered in tattered robes, the undead creature lurches forward with a stiff, hopping motion, and baring claw-like hands. A thin strip of paper covered in tiny writing hangs from its hat._

**_Inauspicious Burials_**. A jiangshi is created when burial rites are carried out improperly. Unable to leave the body, the tortured soul re-animates the corpse after rigor mortis has set in, giving the jiangshi its rigid posture and nickname as a "hopping vampire." A jiangshi has a burial prayer written on a small scroll stitched to its forehead or hat, warding it against magic.

**_Bizarre Gaits_**. Stiff-limbed and hunched, jiangshi move around by hopping, rather than walking, in search of living prey. It can make enormous leaps to catch a foe, and, when it grabs hold of a victim, it sucks out the creature's breath. Jiangshi are blind, detecting living victims by listening for the sounds of breathing. It is possible to remain undetected by a jiangshi by holding one's breath and keeping very still.

**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The jiangshi doesn't require air or sleep.
