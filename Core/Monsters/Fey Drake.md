## Description
---
_The small dragon flicks its tongue, light glinting off its purpleâ€‘black scales. The gleam in its eye hovers somewhere between mischief and malice._

**_Divine Servant_**. The oldest and most capricious drakes catch the eye of the god of dragons who imbues them with its power. That lucky drake then becomes a fey drake, a (mostly) faithful servant. The fey drake's main duties to its master generally involve finding people, spying on them, and, when appropriate, convincing them to perform tasks for the god of dragons. In the best cases, the task is something the person wants to do, and harmony prevails. In cases where the person is less agreeable, the fey drake uses its magic to force the person to comply.


**_But Still Capricious_**. Fey drakes, however, have a streak of unpredictability. Something that seems like a good idea at the time, or something that might be a bad idea but be fun, is exactly what a fey drake is likely to do without regard for the long-term consequences. The fey drake is more prone to mischief than even its most mischievous draconic cousins.


> [!INFO] Silvaniel, the Demigod of Fey Drakes
>Fey drakes are surprisingly devoted in their worship of a minor draconic deity named Silvaniel, the trickster friend of Veles, god of all dragons. The role of Silvaniel is to remind grim and brooding Veles of the existence of joy, warmth, friendship, and mischief in the world, for Veles (and many other great dragons) spend much of their time brooding and counting coins. Gnomes, halflings, and some kobolds also venerate Silvaniel.
