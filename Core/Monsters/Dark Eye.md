## Description
---
_This pale-skinned humanoid is swathed in dark robes. Beneath its hood, its face is a grotesque mask. Smooth, featureless flesh is where one eye would be; the existing eye is a black pit that swallows both light and hope._

Dark folk arose when a line of human wizards swore allegiance to shadow gods and passed this shadow power to their children. Easily mistaken for humans at a glance, the dark folk long ago diverged from their ancestors.

Some dark folk carry a stronger measure of shadow in their souls, and it grants them the gift of sight, at the cost of one of their eyes. Staring into that eye threatens to draw the viewer in to its doom.

**_Shadows among Light_**. Dark folk most often live near humanoid settlements. They worship the powers of darkness and shadow in secret, spreading their corruption in the dead of night and in darkened cellars. They often work nocturnal jobs as undertakers, night soil collectors, alchemists, or night watchmen, escaping the unrelenting glare of the sun.

**_Darkened Blood_**. Sometimes a family line carries the tiniest seed of darkness, and a dark folk is born. These pale children face difficult lives, often singled out and shunned by peers for the dark nature they can't ever fully hide. Though most dark folk look human, dark folk can descend from any humanoid (though they lose all traits associated with their heritage).
