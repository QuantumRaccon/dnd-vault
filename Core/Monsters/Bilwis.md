## Description
---
_An enraged mass of malcontents storms across the tavern, overturning tables, busting bottles, and browbeating innocent patrons._

**_Summoned Saboteur_**. The bilwis is an elemental creature. Usually summoned on behalf of another to ruin an enemy's crops, the bilwis hides in the fields until harvest draws near then rips through the crops, devouring and scattering the yield.


**_False Undead_**. The form of a bilwis leads to them being misidentified as a ghost of some kind, and they are often referred to as a "field ghost." Though remedies for a haunting fail to drive them away, the remedies do sometimes add the undead to the list of local maladies when graves are disturbed unnecessarily.


**_Shrouded in Superstition_**. Many farmers believe that if they plant and plow their fields from the outside inward, the bilwis won't be able to find its way in to damage their crops. The bilwis are also blamed for the spread of various illnesses but have no such ability.


**_Elemental Nature_**. The bilwis doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
