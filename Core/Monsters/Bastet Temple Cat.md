## Description
---
_A slim feline far larger than any house cat slips from the shadows. Its coat glistens like ink as it chirps, and its tail flicks teasingly as its golden eyes observe the doings in its temple._

**_Bred for Magic_**. Temple cats of Bastet are thought by some to be outsiders, but they are a terrestrial breed, created by the priesthood through generations of enchantment.

**_Lazy Temple Pets_**. By day, temple cats laze about their shrines and porticos, searching out attention from the faithful and occasionally granting boons when it suits then.

**_Fierce Shrine Guardians_**. By night, they serve as guardians in their temples, inciting would-be thieves to come close before viciously mauling them. More than one would-be rogue has met his or her fate at the claws and teeth of these slim, black-furred beasts. Bastet temple cats are fierce enemies of temple dogs.
