## Description
---


Creatures that encounter a sibriex can be twisted beyond recognition. Whenever a creature fails a saving throw against the sibriex's Warp Creature effect, you can roll percentile dice and consult the Flesh Warping table to determine an additional effect, which vanishes when Warp Creature ends on the creature. If the creature transforms into an abyssal wretch, the effect becomes a permanent feature of that body.

A creature can willingly submit to flesh warping, an agonizing process that takes at least 1 hour while the creature stays within 30 feet of the sibriex. At the end of the process, roll once on the table (or choose one effect) to determine how the creature is transformed permanently.

|**d100**|Effect|
|---|-----------|
|01-05|The color of the target's hair, eyes, and skin becomes blue, red, yellow, or patterned.|
|06-10|The target's eyes push out of its head at the end of stalks.|
|11-15|The target's hands grow claws, which can be used as daggers.|
|16-20|One of the target's legs grows longer than the other, reducing its walking speed by 10 feet.|
|21-25|The target's eyes become beacons, filling a 15-foot cone with dim light when they are open.|
|26-30|A pair of wings, either feathered or leathery, sprout from the target's back, granting it a flying speed of 30 feet.|
|31-35|The target's ears tear free from its head and scurry away; the target is [[deafened]].|
|36-40|Two of the target's teeth turn into tusks.|
|41-45|The target's skin becomes scabby, granting it a +1 bonus to AC but reducing its Charisma by 2 (to a minimum of 1).|
|46-50|The target's arms and legs switch places, preventing the target from moving unless it crawls.|
|51-55|The target's arms become tentacles with fingers on the ends, increasing its reach by 5 feet.|
|56-60|The target's legs grow incredibly long and springy, increasing its walking speed by 10 feet.|

|76-80|The target becomes thin and skeletal, halving its weight.|
|81-85|The target's head doubles in size.|
|86-90|The target's ears become wings, giving it a flying speed of 5 feet.|
|91-95|The target's body becomes unusually brittle, causing the target to have vulnerability to bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.|
|96-00|The target grows another head, causing it to have advantage on saving throws against being [[charmed]], [[frightened]], or [[stunned]].|
