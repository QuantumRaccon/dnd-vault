## Description
---
_A pair of fiery nested chariot wheels spin slowly in the air. Though engulfed in flames, the wheels do not burn._

**_Enigmatic and Silent_**. Perhaps the most enigmatic of the angels, the ophanim appear alongside other angels, rarely speaking themselves. These angelic beings usually take the form of a flaming wheel with another wheel transverse to it within, the outer rims covered in unblinking eyes. They have also been known to take the form of an empty throne of fire.
**_Herald of a God's Will_**. The accompanying presence of an ophanim in any form signifies divine justice and the direct attention of the deity whom it serves. Other angels treat the ophanim with great respect, feeling the weight of their deity's will in the heat of the ophanim's rings.
**_A Symbol or a Weapon_**. Though they can speak, ophanim tend to communicate a god's displeasure with awesome destructive power, delivering the punishment decreed by the angel they accompany.
**_Immortal Nature_**. The ophanim angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
