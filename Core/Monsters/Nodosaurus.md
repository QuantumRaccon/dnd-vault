## Description
---
_The nodosaurus is a broad-backed, armor-plated herbivore with a gentle disposition. When provoked or attacked, it can turn and slap opponents with its tail, but its thick hide and the spikes protruding from its side discourage most would-be predators from anything more than a cursory look._

Lizardfolk have long trained the dinosaurs as beasts of burden, and a single nodosaurus is capable of carrying nearly all of the material a migratory tribe could hope to bring along.
