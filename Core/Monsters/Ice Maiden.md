## Description
---
_This alluring beauty has flesh and hair as white as snow and eyes blue as glacial ice._

**_Born of the Ice_**. Ice maidens are the daughters of powerful creatures of the cold. Some are descendants of Boreas or the Snow Queen (a few having both parents), but they are also born to frost giants and thursir. A few result from tearful pleas by pregnant women lost in the snows, desperate to keep their newborn child from freezing to deathâ€”the fraughashar carry these infants away and raise them as ice maidens.

**_Solitary Lives_**. Most ice maidens live solitary existences save for a servant or two under their thrall. They're lonely creatures, desperate for love but condemned to know companionship only through their magical kiss. If genuine love ever fills an ice maiden's heart, she'll melt into nothingness.

**_Killing Dilemma_**. An ice maiden's hunger for affection and human contact leads them to harm those they approach, which only drives them harder to seek for warmth, love, and approval. Some claim an ice maiden can become a swan maiden or a dryad if she keeps a lover's heart warm for a full year.
