## Description
---
_Among the more bizarre products of diabolic fleshwarping, the wind's harp is a living object. Though a few might mistake it for an ordinary instrument, once a wind's harp devil squirms and plucks forth a jarring note, its bizarre, living shape is impossible to mistake for anything else._

Loud, harsh, and prone to unleashing their racket at every possible opportunity, wind's harp devils serve the courts of Hell as background music and as instruments of sonic and psychic torture. [[deva \|Devas]] and [[kinnara]] are particular targets of wind's harp devils.

**_Arcane Counters_**. Intelligent devils often bring along a wind's harp devil to counter the spells of a wizard, bard, sorcerer, or other spellcaster. Devils in this position leave the wind's harp devil in the back ranks, protected by a few minor underlings.


**_Friend to Winds_**. Wind's harp devils are on good terms with air elementals, wind demons, and similar creatures of air and song. They often work together against foes.


**_Rich Materials of Disguise_**. The body of a wind's harp devil often resembles fine rosewood or mahogany. To enhance this appearance, they often glue mother-of-pearl or silver ornaments on themselves to appear more like an inanimate object. Once their red eyes open and their strings and mouths utter their screaming wails, this illusion cannot be sustained.
