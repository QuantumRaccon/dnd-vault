## Description
---
_The creature towers out of a nightmare. It is humanoid from the waist up and serpentine from the waist down with its lower body splitting into two tails. Great scaled, leathery wings sprout from its shoulders, and its arms fork into nests of hissing snakes just below the elbow. Its eyes are baleful flames, casting ugly shadows into its wild hair and beard._

Typhon is the Father of Monsters and Master of the Lamias. This towering demon lord lives in bitter exile, chained to his level of the Abyss by defeat in an ancient conflict against the powers of good. He broods in the depths of his cavern, hoarding stolen wealth and spawning ever more hideous creatures to unleash upon the multiverse.

**_Desperate for Escape_**. While most demon lords can't easily leave their demesnes within the Abyss for various reasons, Typhon's very essence is bound beneath his mountain by the powers of heaven. No known portal, spell, ritual, or even divine intervention yet attempted can release him. His influence can slip through the cracks in the planes in the form of his demons and spawn, but the Father of Monsters himself can find no such release. He is obsessed with finding the key to his prison and will spare no amount of effort nor show a shred of mercy in pursuit of the solution.

**_Eyes, Ears, and Claws_**. Of all the creatures that crawl into existence under Typhon's corrupted touch, his favorites are the lamia. Conventional demonology holds the lamia were created by a different demon lord originally, but Typhon delights in subverting that supposed truth. Lamia created or blessed by Typhon vary from the expected norm of a lower leonine body and sport a variety of bestial lower bodies. Snake tails are the most common, but the lower bodies of boars, crocodiles, sharks, and even spiders have been reported.
Many lamia abroad in the planes are servants of Typhon, actively seeking out information and power that might free their master from his prison. Besides the lamia, Typhon employs other spies that can often slip into places demons and monstrosities can't. Many planar explorers meet their end after being spared Typhon's fangs and pressed into his service to search out and steal some celestial artifact or demonic power that might lead to his release.


**_Typhon's Lair_**. Typhon rules Tarkoros, a layer of the Abyss covered in dense forests and rocky hills that radiate out from a singular mountain. Within the mount is a honeycomb of tunnels and immense caverns that Typhon fills with beautiful treasure and hideous horrors. Monsters of all kinds spring up in the shadow of Typhon's wings. The creatures lurk in the halls of Tarkoros and spill out to seek portals to the Material Plane.
