## Description
---
_An evil wind swirls out of the desert, parching those it touches, whispering evil plans. These winds are the edimmus._

**_Bitter Exiles_**. Desert and plains tribes often exile their criminals to wander as outcasts. A banished criminal who dies of thirst sometimes rises as an edimmu, a hateful undead that blames all sentient living beings for its fate.

**_Rise Again_**. Unless its body is found and given a proper burial, an edimmu is nearly impossible to destroy. While edimmus linger near their corpses, they often follow prey they have cursed to seal the creature's fate. Once that creature is slain, they return to the site of their demise.
