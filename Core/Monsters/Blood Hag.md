## Description
---
_This bent-backed crone has long, leathery arms and cruel, flesh.shearing talons. Her face is a misshapen mass of leathery flesh with a bulbous nose, like a gnarled knot on an old oak tree._

**_Vampiric Origins_**. Blood hags have long skulked on the fringes of society. The first blood hags appeared when a red hag mated with a mad vampire archmageâ€”their offspring became the first blood hags. Many more followed.

**_Face Stealers_**. Blood hags prey on mankind, stealing their seed to propagate, their blood to satisfy their insatiable thirst, and their faces as trophies of these short-lived and bloody trysts.

**_Worm Hair_**. A blood hag's hair is a morass of wriggling worms, ever thirsty for fresh blood.
