## Description
---
>Eight long, writhing tentacles support and propel this snarling horror's oblong body while its jagged maw reveals rows of razor teeth.

**_Invisible Hunter_**. The ulnorya lives to hunt, using its natural invisibility to surprise prey or swiftly chase down its next meal. Replicating itself allows the ulnorya to be its own hunting partner, and it uses this to stage ambushes or surround its victims.

**_Magical Oddity_**. Whether it was created by a mad druid or some arcane guild's ill-advised experimentation, the ulnorya combines elements of spiders, scorpions, and octopuses. Asexual as a species, ulnorya create new offspring by implanting an egg within corpses slain by the ulnorya's poison. Within five days, the egg hatches into a new ulnorya.
