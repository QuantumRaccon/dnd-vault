## Description
---
>A diminutive blue humanoid with sharp black claws and exaggeratedly pointed ears floats in the air, emanating a palpable sensation of cold.

**_Cursed Fairy_**. Warmth thieves were fey in the court of the [[Queen of Night and Magic]] (Tome of Beasts) who had the peculiar ability to rob living creatures of their body heat. They attempted to use this power to overthrow the Queen... and failed. The Queen, amused, allowed them to live, but with a nasty curse: warmth thieves must steal body heat to live, perishing if they don't regularly take heat from living creatures. Warmth thieves can't tolerate temperatures much above freezing, preventing them from subverting the curse by moving to warmer climates. Their desire for warmth is so powerful they sometimes throw themselves at creatures that can magically create fire to enjoy a brief, though painful, respite from their suffering.

**_Unintended Side Effects_**. Unknown to the Queen of Night and Magic, her curse transfers in an odd way to mortal beings who die at the warmth thieves' bone-chilling touch. When warmth thieves' victims die, their spirits return as [[chill haunts]], which are not under the fey's control. Warmth thieves have tried with varying levels of success to recruit chill haunts in their schemes to retaliate against the queen and her court.

**_Social Creatures_**. Warmth thieves once enjoyed the company of other fey. Now unwelcome in fey courts, they content themselves with the companionship of mortals, taking care not to stay too long in warm buildings. They must balance this desire for camaraderie with the need to drain warmth from the same creatures with whom they spend time. They may feel a twinge of regret at their actions, but they have no problem moving on to another village to start anew.
