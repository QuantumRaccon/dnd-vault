## Description
---
_The first one hopped out of the stream with a foul noise; its many mouths chirping with a disquieting "reepmaok, reepmaok" sound. All might have died if not for the captain, who smacked a horse and drove it to sudden movement; the cipactli swarmed and stripped it to bones while our party fled._

Cipactli are a hideous, demonic blend of the worst elements of crocodilians and deepwater fish with some of the coloration of a poisonous frog. They have scaled hide, a spiked tail with a spine, and toothy maws at each joint.

**_Swift Spawning_**. The cipactli are all hermaphrodites or of indefinite gender, laying eggs in their fallen foes. These fiendish eggs hatch into young, froggish cipactli within a week, and their parent generally leaves them at least one large carcass as nourishment.


**_Ravenous Raiders_**. Always hungry and ever-seeking easy prey, a cipactli demon steals blood and animal sacrifices from temples, devours goats and cattle in their barns, consumes carrion, demands sacrifices, and has been known to hypnotize then eat human victims so silently that others sleeping nearby never wake.


**_Friends of Elementals_**. The cipactli were witnesses to the creation of the world, and their bloodline traces back to the earliest instances of fire, water, earth, void, and air. All elementals are at least somewhat respectful to a cipactli, and the two occasionally form alliances. Water elementals, in particular, often inhabit the same rivers, wells, and oceans as cipactli.
