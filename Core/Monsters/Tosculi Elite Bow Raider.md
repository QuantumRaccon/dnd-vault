## Description
---
Tosculi elite bow raiders are smarter and more capable than drones and common warriors, with midnight black or deep green carapaces that shine with colorful iridescence. Their wings are blood red, streaked with dark crimson veins. Elite bow raiders also tower over common tosculiâ€”they stand over 5 feet tall and weigh 130 lb.

**_Warband Leaders_**. Elite bow raiders lead larger raiding parties of warriors and drones to gather slaves and sacrifices. As rare and prized members of the hive, a bow raider's life is never thrown away like drones' or risked unnecessarily. Seldom does a tosculi warband contain more than a handful of these elite soldiers, and they frequently hold positions of command. Elite bow raiders always lead the honor guard for their hive-queen, both within the hive and on those rare occasions when the queen ventures outside.
