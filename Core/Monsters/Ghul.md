## Description
---
>A creature wearing a black turban steps out of the sudden fog. It is roughly the size and shape of a short man, with gray skin and pointed teeth. The thing sneers as it summons lightning to its hand, the air suddenly stinking of ozone. Its stony gray skin shifts to an icy blue as it raises its arm to direct its electrical attack.

**_Elemental Remnants_**. When an undead with the ability to raise more of their kind, such as a [[vampire]], [[wight]], or [[wraith]], slays a geniekin or other lesser elemental, the risen creature is a ghul instead. Rather than retaining control of whatever elemental forces it may have had during its life, the ghul becomes representative of all four of the classical elements.

**_Unyielding Hunger_**. Like more common [[ghoul \|ghouls]] and [[ghast \|ghasts]], a ghul's existence is focused around a relentless, agonizing need to consume living flesh. Ghuls favor live targets and can be seen sampling their meal even while battle rages around them. Despite their substantial innate magical ability, some ghuls prefer to rend with their claws, reveling in the tearing of flesh and the sensation of hot blood dripping from their cold bodies.

**_Royal Aspirations_**. Ghuls evolve over the centuries, gaining power and a semblance of their original personality, now twisted by countless evil acts. Their slow personal growth leads most ghuls to a craven existence, striking from the shadows and using their magic to flee if their prey puts up too much of a fight. If a ghul survives long enough, it gains enough power to be grudgingly acknowledged by lesser ghuls. These greater ghuls are often called "ghul kings" by those who encounter them, as the greater ghuls often create a semblance of a "royal court" out of lesser ghuls and other undead.

**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The ghul doesn't require air or sleep.
