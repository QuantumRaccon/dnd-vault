## Description
---


Some adult hill giants like to hurl themselves bodily at smaller foes and crush them beneath their bulk. This ability is represented by the following action option.

**_Squash_**.  **8** to hit, reach 5 ft., one Medium or Smaller creature. {@h}26 (**6d6 + 5**) bludgeoning damage, the giant lands [[prone]] in the target's space, and the target is [[grappled]] (escape DC 15). Until this grapple ends, the target is [[prone]]. The grapple ends early if the giant stands up.
