## Description
---
_A giant, blue octopus sits quietly in the waterlogged ruins of a library, poring over the remnants of ancient clay tablets._

**_Scholarly Wanderers_**. Belying its fearsome appearance, a gargoctopus is an insatiably curious scholar fascinated by the remnants of vanished cultures. It wanders the oceans exploring drowned cities and sunken ships, and occasionally it raises its imposing bulk from the water to investigate relics and ruins on land.


**_Sharing Lore_**. It is in such surroundings that a gargoctopus sometimes encounters terrestrial adventurers. If it views them as trespassers, rivals, or threats, it may react aggressively or even violently, but a gargoctopus treated with careful respect can be a source of great lore. When one gargoctopus encounters another in its travels, the two spend days or weeks exchanging information, ensuring the survival of the knowledge they have each acquired.


**_Tentacle Whirlwind_**. While preferring a life of the mind, an angered gargoctopus becomes a whirlwind of wet, crushing tentacles. Its ability to match the coloration of its flesh to its surroundings, and to adhere to walls and ceilings, makes it an elusive opponent. It can emit a cloud of ink that spreads in air or water, often using it to escape a dangerous situation. A gargoctopus is frequently accompanied by giant octopi serving as loyal bodyguards.
