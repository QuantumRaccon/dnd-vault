## Description
---
>A giant clock walks on four insectoid legs. As a bolt of fire flies at a nearby humanoid, the clock creature's inner gears spin and the fire fizzles into a singe on the humanoid's cloak.

Chronomatic enhancers are constructs made by powerful spellcasters specializing in time-altering magic. Enhancers are protective guardians of their masters and powerful tools the spellcasters can utilize.
**_Time Construct_**. A chronomatic enhancer resembles a large clock with its inner workings clearly visible. It has four beetle-like legs and two arms. Intricate rune-like markings and glowing blue gems sparkle throughout the enhancer's interior. These magical runes allow the chronomatic enhancer to alter time around it in minor ways, aiding allies and hindering foes.

**_Construct Nature_**. The chronomatic enhancer doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
