## Description

>The robed figure formed of tattered shadows and swirling darkness has a bone-white, featureless oval disk where its face should be.

**_Corporeal Shadow_**. Faceless wanderers are creatures made of solid darkness. They are spawned from the Void whenever the minds of a large group of sentient creatures are broken or twisted as a result of exposure to the Void or its denizens. The minds and memories of living creatures draw them to mortal realms.

**_Memory Eater_**. The faceless wanderers survive by stealing memories from sentient humanoids and create new faceless wanderers when they completely drain a humanoid of its memories. Curiously, faceless wanderers don't harm young humanoids and sometimes even aid them. Scholars speculate this odd behavior is because children possess fewer memories than adults.

**_Void Traveler_**. The faceless wanderer doesn't require air, food, drink, sleep, or ambient pressure.
