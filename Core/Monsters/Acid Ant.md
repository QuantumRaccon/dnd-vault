## Description
---
_An ant the size of a housecat with a throbbing green abdomen gnaws everything in sight. Hissing liquid drips from its chittering mandibles._

Though a single acid ant is barely a problem, these colonial insects travel in acid-spewing hordes that can lay waste to an entire village in a matter of hours.
**_Endless Appetite_**. The arcane energy that swirls within acid ants keeps them constantly hungry. Their acidic bite allows them to devour almost any matter, though acid ants prefer the taste of meat. The beasts stay in an area until they have consumed everything organic and then hunt for more food, carving a path of devastation wherever they go.
**_Potential Weapons_**. Many militaries have thought to capture and then unleash acid ants upon enemy troops. Such a challenge often results in those militaries losing their own soldiers to the ants. First, the ants must be captured. Then those ants must be held in acidâ€‘proof housings; otherwise they are not contained for long. If these initial steps can be accomplished, the next challenge is releasing the ants in a way that they devour only enemies. Armies that can solve these problems master the art of destruction.
**_Unknown Origin_**. No one knows how acid ants came to be, but elemental magic was involved. Perhaps they are the product of a deranged wizard's experiment or an elemental summoning ritual gone awry. Scholars and adventurers hunt for the origin of these beasts, searching for knowledge to better understand and annihilate the ants.
**_Ant Colony_**. Acid ants are sometimes found with ordinary [[giant ant \|giant ants]] and [[giant ant queen \|giant ant queens]] (Tome of Beasts). In these cases, the acid ants are a specialized warrior caste within the hive that still answer to the queen.
