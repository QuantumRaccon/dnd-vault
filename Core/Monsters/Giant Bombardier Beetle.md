## Description
---
Many types of beetles inhabit the world, and, depending on the location and culture, they are used as food, companions, or beasts of burden by its people.
**_Forest Beetles_**. Giant bombardier beetles lurk on the forest floor. A placid herbivore content to go about its business, the beetle has a powerful defense mechanism in the form of a boiling liquid it can spray to scald would-be predators as it makes its escape.

**_Companions and Familiars_**. Forest rangers often train bombardier beetles as companions, valuing the beetle's spray for its ability to deter beasts without setting fire to the forest.
