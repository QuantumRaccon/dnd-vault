## Description
---
Camazotz looks like a hunched, lean man, covered in short black fur and with large membranous wings. His lips, pulled back in a sinister smile, reveal a mouth lined with crooked, needlelike teeth. His eyes glow red like burning embers of hate. Long arms end in cruel claws, and the air around him shimmers with waves of intense heat.

**_Underworld Bat Lord_**. Camazotz is a being of pure savagery and hatredâ€”a vile demon that holds sway over bats, vampires, and the lightless places of the underworld. In the deep recesses of the earth and the caves connecting to the surface, he waits restlessly until the slow creep of night engulfs the land, releasing him to feed and spread terror.

**_New Fiery Mantle_**. Recently, Camazotz stole the fire aspect of the decrepit Huhueteotl, Lord of the Hearth and the Fire of Life. With his new prestige, Camazotz has attracted new followers, served notice to the gods of his ascendancy, and solidified his place in the Abyss as a power to be reckoned with. Cults of derro, goblins, and humans praise his name in the darkness.

**_Emerging from Darkness_**. With his blindsense, Camazotz much prefers darkness to light, but with his new ability to play with fire and light, he grows increasingly confident in daylight.


**_Demon Lords_**. Demonic powers swarm throughout the lower planes without number. Ancient beasts fade from mortal history, only to reappear eons later when their schemes draw them back to the Material Plane.
