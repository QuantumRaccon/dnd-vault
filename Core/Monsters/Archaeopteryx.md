## Description
---
_An enraged mass of malcontents storms across the tavern, overturning tables, busting bottles, and browbeating innocent patrons._

The archaeopteryx is either a feathered lizard which flies or a bird with teeth and small claws on its wings; opinions vary. It is about the size of a raven with similar black plumage, long legs ending in talons, and a long, fan-like tail. Its beak is lined with small, sharp teeth. The archaeopteryx favors warm, coastal areas, swamps, and jungles.

>Scaled citizens of the Mharoti Empire have domesticated the archaeopteryx, training them in a similar fashion to falconry, though the preferred prey consists of small land mammals instead of birds in flight. Ownership of a trained archaeopteryx carries with it something of an air of sophistication and luxury, particularly among dragonborn.
