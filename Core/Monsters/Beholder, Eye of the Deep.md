## Description
---
The eye of the deep is a cousin of the beholder spawned in the deepest chasms of the Plane of Water. It appears as a spherical crustacean, eight feet across, with thick chitinous plates covering its bulk. A single eye sits in its center from which it can emit a blinding light, particularly effective in the Darkened Depths. It possesses two large pincers and a mouth full of crooked, razor- sharp teeth, which it uses to rend flesh from blinded or stunned opponents. Unlike a normal beholder, it only has two eye stalks, but both are tuned to help it hunt in deep waters.

**_Solitary Hunters_**. Eyes of the Deep lurk in the aquatic depths of the Plane of Water, stalking prey for days on end. Like all beholders, they are xenophobic, each believing that they are the pinnacle of beholder perfection. The darkness of their territory drives them to solitude, so they are rarely encountered with minions.
**_Shiny Objects_**. If an eye of the deep has one weakness, it is for shiny objects. Their lairs are often decorated with the pilfered treasures of their past meals, but only if they reflect their blinding light. Mirrors are prized above all elseâ€”they are shiny and they let the eye of the deep admire their own perfect form.
