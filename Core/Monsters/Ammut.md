## Description
---
_Lumbering across the sand, these massive monsters have the head of a crocodile, the body of a lion, and the hind quarters of a hippopotamus._

**_Touched by Radiance_**. Known as "devourers of the dead," ammut are said to have descended from a deity whose domain included the judgment of souls. The monsters have maintained a small portion of this heritage, and their blood is valued by alchemists for use in potent healing draughts.
**_Bane of the Undead_**. Ammut are known to devour the walking dead, often swallowing them whole. The undead persist in the belly of the creature and are eventually absorbed by the ammut, setting the souls of the dead to permanent rest. It is said that powerful priests from distant sand-bound empires ride ammut into battle against undead armies.
