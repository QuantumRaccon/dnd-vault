## Description
---
_The dread sons of Fenris are hideously strong and dangerous in their mastery of the arcane. Their acidic breath stinks of death, and they move with a menacing grace. Eldritch blood runs in their veins._

**_Demonic Wolves_**. Demonic black eyes, two snakelike tongues, and green-black scales beneath their thick black fur betray their unnatural origins. Although the sons of Fenris are powerful spellcasters, they prefer physical violence, using their spells only if faced with foes they cannot simply tear apart.

**_Hibernate Until Ravenous_**. Sons of Fenris are creatures of hunger, rage, and madness. They can subsist on infrequent gorging, so they slumber beneath the snow for weeks or months, waking when they grow ravenous or when prey approaches close enough to smell. When hunting, they revel in wanton savagery and destruction, killing entire flocks or herds to delight in blood and to cast runes among the entrails.

**_Desperate Worshipers_**. Despite their fierce nature, all the sons of Fenris are wise in divine lore, and desperate souls offer them worship and sacrifice in exchange for aid. The sons of Fenris enjoy this adulation, and provide protection, meat, and wisdom to their followers. In some cases, they gather enormous war bands over winter and going reaving in the spring.
