## Description
---
_The wings of this giant insect feature bold patterns that give it camouflage and intimidate would-be predators. Two large antennae quiver from its head, and a long, sharp tongue-like proboscis unfurls during feeding._

Moths are old creatures, and they have survived through ages and events that other species have not. For this reason, though their coloration may not be as vibrant as butterflies and their flight not as graceful as dragonflies, moths are considered by many to possess great wisdom.

**_Symbols of Death_**. Some cultures believe certain varieties of moths are omens of death or of the passing of one phase into another. These moths typically have darker coloration and may feature ominous-looking patterns on their wings.
