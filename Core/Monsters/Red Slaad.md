## Description
---


Implanted in the slaad's brain is a magic control gem. The slaad must obey whoever possesses the gem and is immune to being [[charmed]] while so controlled.

Certain spells can be used to acquire the gem. If the slaad fails its saving throw against [[imprisonment]], the spell can transfer the gem to the spellcaster's open hand, instead of imprisoning the slaad. A [[wish]] spell, if cast in the slaad's presence, can be worded to acquire the gem.

A [[greater restoration]] spell cast on the slaad destroys the gem without harming the slaad.

Someone who is proficient in Wisdom (Medicine) can remove the gem from an [[incapacitated]] slaad. Each try requires 1 minute of uninterrupted work and a successful DC 20 Wisdom (Medicine) check. Each failed attempt deals 22 (**4d10**) psychic damage to the slaad.
