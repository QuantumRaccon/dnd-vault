## Description
---
_This oddly-proportioned figure weaves its too-long arms in intricate gestures as arcane energy crackles through its thick strands of hair._

Portal masters are physically indistinguishable from other ramag, though they tend to occupy a higher station. Their clothing and equipment often clearly mark them as spellcasters. The surest mark of a portal master is a gate seal, a large ring of silver, mithral, iron, and copper twisted together. The seal is a focus for the portal master's spellcasting and its manipulation of planar fabric.

**_Keepers of the Gates_**. Portal masters fill a potent role within ramag society; they exist to nullify portals, teleportation, and other methods of interplanar travel. Sometimes the flows of magic and the stars align, causing dormant gates to flicker to life. Beyond these gates lie ruins of the ancient titans and lost vestiges of ramag settlements. While some explorers take advantage of the opportunity to reclaim lost knowledge and wealth (and many are lost when the gates slam shut without warning), the portal masters are the first line of defense when other, fouler things come through from the other side.
