## Description
---
>This creature is a well-coifed humanoid with perfectly arranged hair, manicured hands, and noble dress. Its baleful red eyes and pointed ears betray its supernatural origin.

**_Alternate Form of Vampire_**. Psychic vampires originate in much the same way as traditional vampires: by being bitten by a normal [[vampire]]. At some point, however, a small minority of those who become this fearsome type of undead develop not a craving for blood, but rather a need to consume the memories of their victims. Typically, those who develop into this form of vampire were people who were overly cerebral, often coming from the ranks of wizards, sages, or artists. Many psychic vampires keep [[repository \|repositories]] in their employ, prizing the construct's ability to keep and protect knowledge too valuable to leave on a library shelf.

**_Limited Vampiric Abilities_**. Strangely, while psychic vampires share the same basic undead form as well as the sheer brutality of the standard vampire, they do not possess some of their other abilities, such as the ability to shapechange or turn into mist. For that reason, they typically plan their lairs in ways that provide them easier methods of escape should the need arise. They also tend to be a bit less arrogant than the typical vampire, substituting that with raw intensity and intricate planning to advance their schemes.

**_Undead Nature_**. A psychic vampire doesn't require air.


**_A Psychic Vampire's Lair_**. Psychic vampires choose lairs similar to the lairs of standard vampires, but psychic vampire lairs often include grand libraries, majestic ballrooms, or other rooms related to the cerebral pastime the vampire enjoyed in life.
