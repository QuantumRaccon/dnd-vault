## Description
---
>This flabby creature squints with beady eyes, licks its lips, and places a bone-white hand to the gaping hole punched through its chest.

**_Miserable Visage_**. Woe siphons are a sad sight when compared to their beautiful and terrible fey brethren. They appear as misshapen humanoids with translucent, glossy skin. All woe siphons possess a through-and-through hole in the chest where their heart should be. When underfed, this hole appears ragged and torn, like a fresh wound. When well-fed, a fragile layer of skin forms over the gap.

**_Pain Gorger_**. Woe siphons feed on negative emotions. To sustain themselves, many migrate to places where sentient creatures suffer in vast numbers or where historical suffering took place, such as mass graves or ancient battlefields. Particularly deadly or dangerous underground locales are common hunting grounds of the hungry woe siphon. Once inside such a place, a woe siphon inflicts suffering on any who cross its path. A favorite tactic involves invisibly stalking adventuring parties to torment their victims for as long as possible before attacking outright.
