## Description
---
_A primitive and relatively diminutive form of giant, forest marauders claim the wilderness areas farthest from civilization when they can._

**_Painted Skin_**. Roughly the size and shape of an ogre, this brutish thing is covered in paint or colored mud. An exaggerated brow ridge juts out over piggish, close-set eyes, and corded muscle stands out all over the creature.

**_Keep to the Wilderness_**. Cruel and savage when encountered, their demeanor has worked against them and they have nearly been driven to extinction in places where they can be easily tracked. They have since learned to raid far from their hidden homes, leading to sightings in unexpected places.

**_Orc Friends_**. Forest marauders get along well with orcs and goblins, who appreciate their brute strength and their skill at night raids.
