## Description

>An unnatural, cloying chill fills the air, and multiple ghostly hands burst from a wall to pummel and grab all within reach.

**_Unassuming Horror_**. The walled horror is an undead that appears to be a normal stretch of wall until it lashes out at passersby.

**_Tragic Origins_**. A walled horror is created when a group of humanoids is bound together and entombed behind a wall in an area with a high concentration of necrotic energy. The humanoids experience profound terror before dying of thirst or suffocation, and their spirits remain trapped within the wall, becoming an undead that seeks to add others to its collection.

**_Entombed Treasures_**. While the spirits of the entombed victims join with the stone and mortar of the wall, their bodies and belongings are left to rot in the cavity behind the wall. When the walled horror is destroyed, it collapses into a pile of rubble, revealing the remains and belongings.

**_Undead Nature_**. A walled horror doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
