## Description

>This giant has a bulky, muscular body and small eyes in its broad, flat face. The giant's thumbs end in large, black claws.

**_Ancient Giants of the Deep_**. Abbanith giants are among the oldest races of giants known to exist and are said to have been around since the world was first formed. Many scholars turn to the giants' deep connection with the earth as evidence of this fact, and the giants themselves make no efforts to deny it. Indeed, the oral tradition of the abbanith giants dates back millennia, to a time when gods walked the land, elves were first learning the secrets of magic, and humans were still living in caves. Most abbanith giants wear simple tunics or shorts woven of a strange subterranean fungus, though leaders occasionally wear armor.

**_Consummate Diggers_**. Abbanith giants dwell almost exclusively underground and are adept at using their incredibly hard thumb claws to dig massive tunnels through the earth. Druids and wizards studying the giants' unique biology have deduced that mineral-based materials actually soften when struck by their claws. This feature has also made them the target of [[derro]] and [[duergar]] slavers wishing to use their skills to mine precious gems or build their fortifications, something the giants violently oppose despite their normally peaceable nature.

**_Allies of the Earth_**. For as long as either race can remember, abbanith giants have been allies of the pech, the two races sharing a passion for all things earth and stone. Families of abbanith giants frequently live with pech colonies, the abbanith giants harvesting the stone the pech work and the two races sharing in the defense of the community. Abbanith giants defer to their smaller pech friends in most matters of importance, and many outsiders view the fondness and attentiveness that the much larger giants have for their stony friends with bemusement.
