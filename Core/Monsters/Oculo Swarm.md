## Description
---
_This collection of hundreds of eyes floats along, trailing ganglia and dripping caustic fluid that sizzles when it hits the ground._

**_Failed Experiment_**. An oculo swarm results from an experiment to create a live scrying sensor that went poorly. Once set loose, these horrors attain a form of distributed selfawareness. Exactly what motivates them is unknown, except that they are driven to survive.

**_Flesh Stealers_**. A weakened oculo swarm can reinvigorate itself by tearing fresh eyes from almost any type of living creature. If a badly depleted oculus swarm escapes from battle—and they seldom fight to the death unless cornered—it attacks lone creatures or weak groups until the mass of gore-spattered eyeballs is replenished. The more dismembered eyeballs the swarm contains, the more powerful its paralyzing resonance field becomes.

**_Single Eye Scouts_**. The entire swarm sees what any single member sees. Before attacking or even entering a potentially dangerous area, individual eyes scout ahead for prospective victims or dangerous foes. A lone eye has no offensive capability and only 1 hp. It can travel only 100 feet away from the main swarm, and it must return to the swarm within an hour or it dies.

> [!INFO] Oculo Swarms in Midgard
>Bemmean wizards have been known to employ oculus swarms as lie detectors during negotiations. An oculus instinctively reads eye movements, and it can communicate what it sees to the wizard by moving in a specific way or by changing the color of its irises. If negotiations go poorly, the mage gives the swarm permission to add a fresh pair of eyes to its number.
