## Description
---


Grung poison loses its potency 1 minute after being removed from a grung. A similar breakdown occurs if Yorb dies. A creature [[poisoned]] by a grung can suffer an additional effect that varies depending on Yorb's skin color. This effect lasts until the creature is no longer [[poisoned]] by Yorb.

**_Green_**. The [[poisoned]] creature can't move except to climb or make standing jumps. If the creature is flying, it can't take any actions or reactions unless it lands.
**_Blue_**. The [[poisoned]] creature must shout loudly or otherwise make a loud noise at the start and end of its turn.
**_Purple_**. The [[poisoned]] creature feels a desperate need to soak itself in liquid or mud. It can't take actions or move except to do so or to reach a body of liquid or mud.
**_Red_**. The [[poisoned]] creature must use its action to eat if food is within reach.
**_Orange_**. The [[poisoned]] creature is [[frightened]] of its allies.
**_Gold_**. The [[poisoned]] creature is [[charmed]] and can speak Grung.
