## Description
---
This person could easily have been on the other side of the law, but he likes the way he looks in the city watch uniformâ€”and the way city residents look at him when he walks down the street leading a patrol. With a long mustache and a jaunty cap, there's no denying that he cuts a rakishly handsome figure. While a trained investigator, the city watch captain is not afraid to draw his blade to end a threat to his city.
