## Description
---
An eadochas was once a powerful warlock, cursed by its former patron for failing in a task, breaking its pact, or swearing fealty to another. They float a few feet off the ground like spectres and vary in appearance depending on their previous patron and pact boon.

**_A Pact, Broken_**. For whatever reason, through a purposeful choice or through ineptitude, when a warlock breaks their pact, perishes while performing a task, or displeases their patron, they risk becoming an eadochas. These pitiable creatures are twisted into a perverted manifestation of what power they once had; a former Pact of the Blade eadochas' body may be driven through with dozens of rusted blades, causing them constant pain; a Pact of the Chain warlock may be bound with heavy chains, forcing them to carry an unbearable weight for all eternity; a Pact of the Tome warlock may be cursed to have the entirety of their tome stitched into their very skin and carved into their bones.

**_Creature of Despair_**. An eadochas' existence is one of despair. They despair for the power they have lost, they despair for the opportunities they have squandered and they despair for the future that was taken from them. Through the curse, the eadochas can still touch the power of their former patron but it is like a raindrop in the desert for them.

**_Unknowing Tasks_**. Many of these creatures lash out at anyone they can find, particularly those of power. Others journey the lands in the hopes of completing the task they failed in and having their former power returned to them.
