## Description
---
Created by the diseased will of nihileths, these zombies do their creator's bidding without fear or hesitation. While their appearance differs from typical zombies, they too move with the same jerky motions and uneven gait as their undead brethren. The skin and flesh of nihileth zombies is translucent and slimy. They are adept swimmers, and they have no difficulty functioning on dry land, always in service to their masters.
