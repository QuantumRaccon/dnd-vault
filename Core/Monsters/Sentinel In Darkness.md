## Description
---
_A blindfolded, stone face leers down from beneath a hooded cloak stitched from thousands of desiccated treasure maps. With each step the four-armed, stone figure takes, torches sputter, compasses spin, and ink fades._

**_Protector of Secrets_**. Sentinels in darkness are magical constructs tasked with guarding secret vaults and reliquaries. These creatures ward off plunderers with their imposing form, brute strength, and magical nature that obscures secrets. It is said when a sentinel is slain, its cloak of maps burns away, leaving behind one map to a great, secret treasure.

**_Magical Theft_**. Sentinels in darkness can magic away a coveted item, while cursing explorers with an unquenchable desire to find secretsâ€”even at the cost of the explorer's own health.

**_Awakening the Sentinel_**. To animate a sentinel in darkness, the creator must imbue an inert stone golem with the spirit of a mortal that died having taken at least one terrible secret to the grave.

**_Construct Nature_**.  A sentinel in darkness doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
