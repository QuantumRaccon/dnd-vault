## Description
---
This bat has an emaciated, three-foot-long torso and a head that looks like skin stretched over bone. Its jaws are unnaturally distended, and its mouth is full of needle-like teeth. Ghoul bats are popular messengers and pets among darakhul and can be found both in colonies and alone throughout the Ghoul Imperium.
