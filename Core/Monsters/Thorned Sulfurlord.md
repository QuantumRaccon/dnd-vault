## Description
---
_This fiend appears as a humanoid made from ashen twists of briar, but, instead of legs, its torso is connected to a shifting mass of twisting briar and thorns. Its visage is a wooden mask that changes from torment to malevolence to ecstasy. Its powerful hands are encircled by great clouds of yellow, sulfurous smoke. A forge-hot flame burns in its heart with enough intensity to scald living things that draw too close._

**_Immolating Reclaimer_**. Unlike most other fiendish plants whose evil is tempered somewhat by its plant-like origins, the thorned sulfurlord is a craven destructor. Wherever it goes, it burns natural vegetation to cinders and uses this new base to promote the growth of execrable shrubs and devil boughs. It is especially fond of lairing in towns or cities that were reduced to ruins by fire, drawing power and pleasure from burned edifices.

**_Servant to None_**. The thorned sulfurlord does not respect the hierarchy of the Hells or the Abyss. It may form alliances with other fiends or evil creatures, provided the partnership furthers its desire to burn and replace the natural world. It may form a pact with a circle of dark-hearted druids, but only if it is given a large grove to immolate and seed.
