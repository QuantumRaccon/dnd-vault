## Description
---
>This horrible, milk-white creature has the lower body of an emaciated humanoid and the upper body of a slimy jellyfish. Dark blue eyespots cover its upper body, and long, frilled, translucent tentacles trail from its frame-like tassels.

**_Wailing in the Depths_**. Adventurers traveling deep beneath the earth or in the ocean depths sometimes hear an unholy sound echoing toward them out of the blackness, followed by the sight of a creature that is neither human nor jellyfish. This is generally their first and last encounter with the pale screamer, a creature that haunts caves and waterways searching for victims to consume or transport back to the lairs of their terrible alien masters. The pale screamer pursues its mission with malicious relish and enjoys eating its prey alive, often in front of its victims' paralyzed companions.

**_Evil Blooms_**. Though pale screamers are artificial creatures and do not breed naturally, their masters sometimes form them into blooms of two or more for mutual cooperation and protection. These pale screamers learn to communicate with one another by changing the coloration of their eyespots, allowing them to transmit information silently and better ambush or mislead their foes.

**_Formerly Human_**. Pale screamers are created by mixing human and jellyfish-like creatures together using twisted, magical surgery. Most are the result of experimentation by [[aboleth \|aboleths]] or other intelligent eldritch horrors and are brainwashed to serve their masters unquestioningly. Some pale screamers remember snippets of their lives as humans and suffer horrible mental anguish as a result. Most of these pale screamers are disposed of by their masters. The saddest, however, are those that turn rogue and attempt to return to their former lives, only to give into their evil urges for humanoid flesh or be killed by their former family and friends.
