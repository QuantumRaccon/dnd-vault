## Description

You can give a molydeus the ability to summon other demons.

**_Summon Demon (1/Day)_**. As an action, the molydeus has a 50 percent chance of summoning its choice of **1d6** [[babau \|babaus]], **1d4** [[chasme]], or one [[marilith]]. A summoned demon appears in an unoccupied space within 60 feet of the molydeus, acts as an ally of the molydeus, and can't summon other demons. It remains for 1 minute, until it or the molydeus dies, or until the molydeus dismisses it as an action.
