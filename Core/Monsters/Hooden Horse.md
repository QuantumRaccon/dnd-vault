## Description
---
>The creature stands amid a baying crowd, swathed in rags topped by a horse's skull. It brandishes a halberd made of shadow and hisses, "Come forth and be judged!"

**_Strange Great Sins_**. In small villages on a festival eve, one villager plays the village's "sin eater." Bearing a horse's skull on a pole and covered by a draping of tattered skins, the sin eater goes door to door with its crew, seeking payment for the householders' wrongs. The payment usually takes the form of alcohol. As the evening wanes, a drunken procession staggers toward the tavern behind the sin eater. Dark tales relate how, where a terrible wrong has gone unpunished and unpaid, such folk rituals can go awry. The unfortunate sin eater, overwhelmed by a spirit of vengeance, melds with the skull to become a ghastly undead being bent on retribution, a hooden horse.

**_The Madness of The Crowd_**. If the sin eater has drunken hangers-on when it is transformed, the mob also becomes filled with vengeful spite and swarms around the hooden horse, assaulting any who interfere. When this occurs, use the statistics of a [[bar brawl]] (Creature Codex) that follows the hooden horse, helping it seek its vengeance.

**_Retributive Rampage_**. The hooden horse attacks only those it perceives as sinful or those who attack it. Even if defeated, it reforms a year later if any perpetrators of the original crime remain alive and unpunished, though it need not be the hooden horse itself that dispenses this justice.

**_Undead Nature_**. The hooden horse doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
