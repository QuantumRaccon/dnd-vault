## Description
---
_A huge, glowing figure of churning, crackling energy bobs curiously above the battle, watching two warriors attack each other with sword and spear. The battle comes to a swift end when the figure flares, and both warriors slump to the ground, senseless._

**_Born of the Sun._**. As the sun moves across the sky, it sheds smalls bits of itself. Most of these motes of solar energy die out within days, burning themselves to oblivion. But on rare occasions, these bits of star stuff last long enough to gain sentience. They become living stars.

**_The Life of a Living Star_**. Living stars begin as young and immature balls of energy. They roam the heavens, observing the worlds below them. Based on those observations and interactions, they take on personalities and represent larger themes and domainsâ€”not unlike gods. The living stars may even insert themselves into the mortal realm, gaining worshippers and interfering in the lives of the creatures of the world.

**_Radiant Nature_**. A living star doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
