## Description
---
>Parchment inscribed with arcane writing completely covers this creature, leaving room only for its glowing, purple eyes.

A scroll mummy expedites its passage into undeath through an arcane ritual that consumes several scrolls, while incorporating the surviving scrolls into the creature's body, similarly to burial wrappings for an ordinary [[mummy]].
**_Curseless_**. This alternate mummy doesn't carry the same curse as one created through a burial ritual, but its unique, arcane creation does make it particularly deadly to spellcasters. Obsessed with knowledge, the scroll mummy siphons spells from spellbooks, scrolls, and even other spellcasters and inscribes them onto empty parchment on its body. A scroll mummy can use the spells it has inscribed onto its body and jealously guards those scrolls for fear of losing their power. Powerful scroll mummies wrapped in extremely potent scrolls are said to exist but have yet to emerge from their hidden lairs.

**_Undead Nature_**. A scroll mummy doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
