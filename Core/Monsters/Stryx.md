## Description
---
_Stryx are the result of the Moonlit King's mad experiments deep within the plane of Shadows. They resemble owls and can pass as normal birds as long as they don't speak or open their mouths. The stryx have a larger mouth hidden behind their beaks, filled with gleaming human teeth. Stryx range in color from pale gray to sooty black, with gleaming eyes._

**_Strange Alchemy_**. The stryx are unnatural beings that came about through terrible manipulation of normal owls and kidnapped humans. The Moonlit King of the shadow fey, banished and imprisoned in his tower, is desperate to touch the outside world. His crazed experiments blended shreds of mortal souls into shadowy owls and thus brought the stryx into being.

**_The Shadow's Eyes_**. The truth of the stryx is all but unknown outside the Moonlit King's inner circle, where these creatures serve as the king's eyes and ears. Stryx thrive in the plane of Shadow and on the Material Plane equally, and they enjoy attaching themselves to powerful beings as spies, servants, and translators. Their purposes are muddied, however, because they constantly relay what they learn to their mad creator.
