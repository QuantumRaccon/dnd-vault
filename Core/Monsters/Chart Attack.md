## Description
---
**_Constructed Nature_**. An animated object doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
**_A Mysterious Map_**. Chart attacks are constructs which appear to be simple maps made of parchment. They are usually tan or grey in color. All the lines on the map appear to be written in black ink. The area shown on the map always includes the current location. Once someone begins to read the map, the construct will attempt to teleport the reader to a random location on the false map. The legend of these monsters has made people rather wary of using unknown maps.
