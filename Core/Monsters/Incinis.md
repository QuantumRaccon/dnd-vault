## Description
---
_This unusual elemental seems to be made from magma and fire. Its skin is pitch black with glowing cracks forming and closing as it moves. Its face is featureless, except for a great flaming maw that sputters and smokes as it speaks._

**_Curious_**. Incinis are naturally curious creatures, and though they savor the taste of the living, they are likely to greet newcomers before attacking. An incinis is not naive or easily fooled, and it resorts to violence the instant it senses treachery or lies.


**_Volcanic Spirits_**. The incinis are often found on or near pools of magma, and seem to be capable to shaping and directing the flows of lava from active volcanoes.


**_Elemental Nature_**. The incinis doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
