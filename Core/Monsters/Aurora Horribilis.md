## Description

>A ribbon of light flies just above the ground, its gleam flickering in and out of view as it emits a discordant tune.

**_Hidden Among Polar Lights_**. Though auroras horribilis can manifest anywhere on a world, they prefer to dance and sing within naturally-occurring auroras. When they notice admirers of boreal lights, they descend from the sky to share their songs. Unfortunately, they are unaware of the bewilderment their songs invoke in listeners and are subsequently surprised by hostile action toward them.

**_Terrible Harbinger_**. While an aurora's direct effects on most creatures is cause for alarm, the aurora's presence is typically a prelude to something worse. Auroras tend to attach themselves to the forefront of a wave of devastation wrought by unknowable beings. Given the nature of such beings, auroras can precede the beings by days or even centuries.
