## Description
---
_Lustrous sand rises from the dunes, forming a translucent crystalline figure. Moments later, it bursts into a shower of glass and begins wandering once more, only to repeat the cycle over again._

A fragrite roams the desert confused and alone. Its unstable body exposes its chaotic, callow nature.

**_Explosive Beginnings_**. When lightning strikes the earth and the conditions are just right, there is a chance for the sand to become glass. When this unlikely occurrence involves enough elemental magic, there is another chance for the vitrified mass to come to life. The awakening of a fragrite is jarring and alarming, even to itself.


**_Beware of Broken Glass_**. Though glass is brittle and easily broken, its razor sharp edges can cut deep. As the fragrite's form is chipped away by its enemies or its own volatile nature, its edges become more jagged and dangerous.


**_Elemental Nature_**. A fragrite doesn't require air, food, drink or sleep.
