## Description
---
_A massive centipede lifts the upper half of its body off the ground, legs thrashing. Acid drips from hungry mandibles stained with liquid metal._

Megapedes are fifteen-foot-long insects that roam underground areas in search of ore to devour. They are particularly fond of softer precious metals.

**_Mine Destroyers_**. Megapedes invade active mines, forcing miners to retreat from their acid-spitting mouths. Ousting an invading megapede becomes a top priority, since the insect eats every vein of ore available. Dwarves train special squads that wear hide armor and wield glass weapons to fight the beasts.

**_Taste for Gold_**. Megapedes prefer the taste of copper, silver, gold, and platinum to other metals. If a morsel of such a metal is nearby, the insect tastes it in the air and abandons all other meals until it can find and consume the treat. Adventurers venturing into megapede lairs should be careful what they carry.
