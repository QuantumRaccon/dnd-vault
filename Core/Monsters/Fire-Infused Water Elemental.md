>A pillar of water rises up into a humanoid shape, steam trailing from its boiling form.

**_Boiling Water_**. Fire-infused water elementals are created when water elementals spend great lengths of time in superheated water, such as the borderlands between the Elemental Planes of Fire and Water, or when they are inundated with large amounts of fire magic. The elementals are irreparably changed and exist in a state between fire and water elemental. Too fiery for one and too watery for the other, they often find their way to the Material Plane, where they can carve out their own territory.

**_Geothermal Dwellers_**. Fire-infused water elementals prefer to inhabit areas with water heated by geothermal activity, such as hot springs and geysers. They claim such locations as their homes and grow violent when creatures harm or pollute their claimed waters. Fire-infused water elementals get along well with [[hverhuldra]], who value the elementals for their strength and ability to discourage violence between visitors.

**_Elemental Nature_**. A fire-infused water elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
