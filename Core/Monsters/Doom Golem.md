## Description
---
_One hears a doom golem long before one sees it; a wailing of despair, a whisper of fate, like a lesser incarnation of death itself._

**_Winter Bound_**. Made of antlers, bone, and steel infused with winter spirits of death and destruction, doom golems are the creations of evil wizards and doomsday cults. They invariably include a hangman's rope, bones of an animal sacrificed to a dark god, and the captured final breath of a man sent to die in exile. A doom golem is animated by a trapped spirit of the arctic, which flees with a howl when the golem is destroyed.


**_Glowing Bones_**. The golem's inner core glows blue, making it easy to see a doom golem after nightfall. Their bone frameworks are sometimes built with polar bear skulls or white dragon bones, and many have a pronounced hunch in their posture.


**_Chorus of Fear_**. A doom golem's clattering bones make noise to terrify foes. Animals find the sound disquieting, but demons, goblins, and other creatures of evil are delighted by the ominous tones.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
