## Description
---
>This bipedal creature seems to be a humanoid-shaped mound of leaves and moss given life. Dark pits in its head resemble empty eye sockets.

**_Protectors of the Lost_**. Ghillie dubhs hail from goodaligned arboreal planes. There, they guide visitors through the sometimes-confounding landscape. They often rescue those who incidentally succumb to the peaceful nature of planar woodlands and might otherwise perish. However, they find their services more useful on the Material Plane where nature is generally more unforgiving. Their desire to help mortals leads them to more extreme climates, with a strong preference for colder weather. Ghillie dubhs find lost travelers and guide these unfortunates to safe places. If a traveler impresses a ghillie dubh with knowledge or a desire for knowledge about the forest, the ghillie dubh gifts the traveler with some of its knowledge.

**_Punishment of Transgression_**. Likewise, a ghillie dubh expects visitors to the area it oversees to be respectful of the land. Ghillie dubhs lecture mild violators and briefly use nature to inconvenience them, such as by covering paths or removing tracks. More heinous acts—like wantonly slaughtering animals or setting trees ablaze—are met with physical retaliation.

**_Part of the Forest_**. Ghillie dubhs take on characteristics of the forests they call home to blend in seamlessly with the trees and other plants. They can listen to subtle variations in the trees' movements to receive early warning about attacks, and they can turn their attention to any part of the forest to ensure no harm is coming to an area.
