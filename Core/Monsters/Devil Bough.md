## Description
---
The devil bough appears as an ordinary tree. It grows in the shape of the trees nearby to increase its chances at surviving past the sapling stage. Each devil bough has a single, fleshy, twisting bough tipped with a spindly, clawed hand. It keeps its this hand hidden as best it can, using it only to catch and devour small animals who flit through its branches.

**_Devourers of Magic_**. Devil bough trees have a natural ability to feed on magical energy, gaining strength and growth spurts from consuming a spell or magical item. For this reason, the trees often inhabit places where magic is found: enchanted pools or interplanar portals.

**_Cannibals_**. The devil bough will gladly eat its own kind or other fiends to sustain itself. However, if meat is scarce in a region, the trees are known to work together along with execrable shrubs to ensure survival.
