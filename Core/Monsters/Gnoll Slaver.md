## Description
---
_With a fistful of chains and shackles and a fat money pouch, the cackling of a successful gnoll slaver is hard to mistake for anything else. They are common in slaveholding societies, though treated with respect only among their own kind._

Occupying a strange role in a human land, gnoll slavers perform duties at which their bestial appearance and nature work to their advantage. They serve as brutal enforcers among the slave population, as captains of raiding bands, and as slave catchers, leading patrols along the land's borders in search of escapees.

**_Brands, Scars, and Marks_**. Gnoll slavers have a fondness for gnawing their victims or threatening the creatures with punishments that scar and mark the victim. Branding slaves is a popular pastime among gnolls.


**_Slain on Sight_**. Races near gnoll slavers tend to show no mercy towards the evil raiders; a captured slaver can expect a speedy execution and often is slain out of hand by a former slave. This merely drives gnoll slavers to some degree of caution; they prefer to operate in groups with other gnolls, and they are often the first to flee if things turn against them.
