## Description
---
The unspeakables were once ordinary humaonids, tragically corrupted and misshapen by the Far Realm's influence.
**_Embodiment of Corruption_**. The unspeakables are aberrations born of ordinary life, malformed and twisted due to the influence of the alien Far Realm. Near portals, the strange dimension of the Far Realm is diffused across space and interacts unpredictably with matter. Living things that come close to these portals or pass through them can be irrevocably changed, forever tainted by the corruption of the Far Realm. Each unspeakable is unique, distinguished by its own random mutations, though a few prominent types do generally emerge from the mutation process.

**_Sundered Minds_**. Of the thousands of mutations that can grip an unspeakable, each and every one is afflicted with unassailable madness. To them, reality as we know it is static, and the signal is something distant, only leaking into reality through the portals. Just as their bodies are torn between the planes, so too are their minds.
Intrusion of living things to a region near a portal is likely to enrage the unspeakables, as the ordered material of our universe causes them great pain. In consequence, the unspeakables unknowingly serve as guardians to the portals of the Far Realm, awakening and attacking all who come near.
