## Description
---
>A slender creature with silvery skin moves delicately, as though unsure if the world around it is real. Star-like motes of white light dance in its black eyes.

A race of fey said to be born from the dreams of an ancient primeval being, yumerai walk in two worlds. Humanoid in appearance, they possess skin tones that range from pale silver to dark gray. Intrinsically tied to the dream world, they can use sleeping creatures as both weapons and transportation.
**_Alien Minds_**. Although yumerai spend most of their time in the waking world, they have difficulty remembering the differences between dreams and reality. This leads some to misunderstand basic laws of physics or to believe dreams events were real events.

**_Dream Walkers_**. A yumerai can enter an individual's dreams and use those dreams as a means of transportation to another's dreams. This process brief connects the creatures, though the yumerai tries not to make its presence known. When multiple people have the same dream, they may have had a yumerai pass through their sleeping minds.

**_The Gift of Sleep_**. For a yumerai, sleep serves as both a tool and a gift. As creatures unable to sleep or dream, the yumerai consider the ability to dream a gift that all mortals should appreciate. As they travel through mortal dreams, yumerai collect energy from the dreams and use it as a form of currency in fey realms. Fey use dream energy in much the same way mortals use paint, creating seemingly alive portraits or making illusions look, smell, sound, or taste more real.

**_The Horror of Nightmares_**. Yumerai usually look forward to the opportunity to experience new dreams. However, not all dreams are pleasant. Particularly horrifying nightmares may leave permanent mental scars on yumerai who witness them, changing them forever. These yumerai take on a sinister and sometimes sadistic personality, seeking to inflict the pain they felt through the nightmare on those around them.

**_Dream Walker_**. A yumerai doesn't require sleep.
