## Description
---
_The head, arms, and torso of this massive figure are composed of metal plates surrounding a core of glowing energy. The whole resembles a vaguely humanoid figure with two metal rings inscribed with glowing runes encircling its fists._

Ring servants are mighty constructs created by ring magic. Though large in stature, they are deceptively light due to their form being composed of energy. A ring servant stands 10 feet tall and weighs 300 pounds

**_Fleeting Form_**. Ring servants are temporary beings, brought into existence by transmuting two simple metal rings into the weapons that surmount the creature's fists. These rings serve as the catalyst that generates the rest of the creature's form. Ring servants aren't mindless. They understand the fleeting span of their existence and don't rebel against it. Exceptions exists, where powerful ring wardens work tirelessly to imbue a ring servant with permanent existence. Such an enduring transformation is rare, however, and the resulting creature may have difficulty coming to terms with lingering in the world.


**_Construct Nature_**. A ring servant doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
