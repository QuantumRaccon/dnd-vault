## Description
---
>This floating creature has numerous writhing tentacles protruding from a body that is hidden inside an enormous shell. The colors of its body shift slowly between grays, greens, and even deep purples.

**_Otherborn_**. Kachlians form in the space between spaces, birthed where madness prevails. They find their way to the darkened caverns beneath the ground through portals of chaos and darknessâ€”breaches in the fabric of reality caused by concentrations of turmoil, despair, and insanity. They are no strangers to the plateaus of Leng, and its denizens give wandering kachlians a wide berth.

**_Eater of Souls_**. The kachlian consumes the souls of creatures, preferring intelligent and enlightened prey. When it consumes a creature, the creature's soul is torn to pieces. The kachlian absorbs the parts it considers valuable into its own being and discards the rest. These partial souls often combine into a twisted amalgam of spirits called a chimeric phantom. Despite the pain of their tormented creation and existence, chimeric phantoms often remain near the kachlian who created them, providing protection and limited companionship.

**_At Home Everywhere_**. Kachlians carry great shells on their backs, remains of unknown creatures from the kachlians' home plane. The interior of each shell has a pocket of extra-dimensional space that holds the kachlian's belongings. The older and more powerful the kachlian, the larger this extra-dimensional space. It is said some ancient kachlians have shells which contain several rooms filled with centuries of wealth. When a kachlian is slain, any creature can access the extra-dimensional space inside the shell; however, the space gradually fades over one month. An object in the extra-dimensional space when it fades is destroyed. A creature in the extra-dimensional space when it fades is deposited in a random location on the Astral Plane.
