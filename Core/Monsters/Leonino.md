## Description
---
_Slightly larger than a housecat and sporting the wings of an owl, the leonino are beloved and rare pets in elvish courts and palaces, where they are kept as companion animals to royal children, courtesans, and gigolos._

The leonino are sometimes found as messengers for powerful elven enchanters, nobles, and rogues. While they can be tamed, most leonino are feral and live on the fringes of halfling settlements, along tropical and temperate coastlines, or in temperate forests, where they devour rodents, frogs, salamanders, and small birds.

**_Listen and Rarely Speak_**. The leonino who live in elvish or halfling settlements invariably learn the language around them and are capable of speaking it. However, their innate hauteur and sense of superiority means that they rarely comment or converse; when they do, they are known for their wit and often quite deadpan humor.

**_Water Couriers_**. The leonino are fond of harborfronts, ships, and fisherfolk of all kinds. They sometimes serve as messengers between elven ships and various harbormasters, other ship's captains, and even pirates and aquatic creatures such as merfolk or deep ones.
