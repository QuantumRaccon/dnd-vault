## Description
---
_Echoing footsteps and brief glimpses reveal a tall, featureless gray figure that disappears as quickly as it appeared._

The fear liath, sometimes referred to by superstitious locals as the Grayman, is a supernaturally thin, ten-foot-tall spectral giant that lurks in the passes between craggy mountain peaks. Graymen stalk travelers and take great pleasure in toying with their prey, typically by timing their footfalls half a step behind their quarry's. All who survive encounters with a fear liath tell of the sound of crunching mountain gravel only a few yards behind themâ€”yet when they turned around, the form of their pursuer was hazy, gray, and utterly featureless.

**_Freed by Slaughter_**. Fear liaths were once mortals and are bound to the Material Plane by a hex known as the Gray Curse. A humanoid slain by a fear liath becomes a Grayman itself, and the fear liath who passed the curse is free to move on to the afterlife. The origin of the first fear liaths is a mystery distorted by millennia of oral legend, but most tellers agree on one detail: the first fear liaths were vain human mountaineers who angered the god of the sun and were cursed to walk the earth as shadows, unable to be seen by other creatures for the rest of existence.


**_Undead Nature_**. The fear liath doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
