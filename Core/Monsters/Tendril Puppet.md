## Description
---
_Moving in odd starts and jerks, these vegetal warriors have thin, green vines growing out from their empty eye sockets, mouth, and ears, and twining around their head, chest, and arms._

Any beast or humanoid can become a tendril puppet if infected by a vine lord.

**_Plant Sentries_**. Tendril puppets mindlessly attack creatures that threaten their forest or jungle. They have no sense of selfpreservation and always fight to the death.

**_Poor Vision_**. Tendril puppets see almost nothing beyond 30 feet away.

**_Root Mind_**. All tendril puppets are connected through a shared consciousness called the root mind; if one tendril puppet is aware of danger, all tendril puppets are aware of it. This includes recognizing foes who slew other tendril puppets or who are wanted by a vine lord, druid, or duskthorn dryad who commands them.
