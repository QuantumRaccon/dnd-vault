## Description
---
_This glittering pool stands among lush and verdant fruiting plants._

**_Underground Oasis_**. A vesiculosa is a huge, burrowing pitcher plant that dwells in oases, spurring nearby growth and luring in prey with soporific scents and tainted water. A vesiculosa's body is buried in the ground, with only its rootlets swarming in the open in ropy tangles. It catches meals with these rootlets and drags them to its mouth. Usually these morsels are unconscious, but the rootlets can put up a fight if they must.

**_Rich Sapphire Heartvine_**. A vesiculosa's heartvine resembles a lump of sapphire and is highly prized by alchemists (worth 1,000 gp). It can be reached with an hour or two of hard digging.
