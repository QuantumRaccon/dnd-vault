## Description
---
>Emerging from the surf, this massive crab-like beast has a hard, blue shell covered in barnacles. It holds a net of seaweed between its barbed claws, and a look of intelligence gleams in its elliptical, crimson eyes.

**_Lurkers in the Shallows_**. The tidehunter is an ambush hunter, using its coloration to surprise prey that venture into the shallows. Tidehunters are normally found along coasts with plentiful beaches and underwater vegetation, but some can be found in large lakes and river systems close to the open ocean. Most tidehunters are more than 20 feet across and are powerful enough to overcome a [[hunter shark]] or small whale with ease. They have few natural predators, their intelligence and guile making them challenging prey.

**_Net Weavers_**. Tidehunters can weave nets out of kelp, seaweed, and other fibrous plant material with ease, constructing nets in a matter of minutes with the weirdly hooked barbs on their claws. Their nets are strong and can be thrown with great accuracy over a large distance. Indeed, even those on dry land are not immune to the tidehunter's attacks, and more than one human has been hauled into the surging tide from the apparent safety of the beach.

**_Fishing Buddies_**. While fisherfolk and tidehunters are normally at odds, a tidehunter will sometimes enter into an unspoken agreement with a group of fisherfolk, sharing the spoils of the sea while keeping out of each other's way.
