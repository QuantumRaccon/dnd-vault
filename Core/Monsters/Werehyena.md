## Description
---
_The hyena's form shifts into that of a gnoll and then to something in between. In all three forms, blood drips from its filthy muzzle._

**_A Blessed Curse_**. Across worlds and in all their cultures, the gnolls have always revered the hyena. Those who suffer the curse of lycanthropy also exhibit it in the same way: the form of a werehyena. This is considered a rare and wonderful gift, as most gnolls who suffer this curse die the first time they change. Those who survive, however, are honored in their culture.

**_A Demonic Affliction_**. In truth, the lycanthropy that werehyenas suffer is a demonic possession. The souls of these creatures have been forfeited to a demon lord. Only gnolls are able to survive this intact. If they spread this disease to a non-gnoll, the victim survives until the first full moon, after which it dies and turns into a demon gnoll under the demon lord's sway. The only way to save the victim is to cure the disease before the first transformation.

**_A Terrible Cure_**. Normally a [[remove curse]] removes lycanthropy from a victim, but slightly more stringent efforts are needed to cleanse a werehyena's bite. While the [[remove curse]] spell is being cast, a demonic creature must be killed in the vicinity of the victim, and the victim must drink the demon's ichor. Only then is the lycanthropy removed permanently. Finding such a creature can be difficult and often means making deals with dark forces.
