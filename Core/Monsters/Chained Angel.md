## Description
---
_Their wings are still feathered, but their soulless eyes betray a great rage and thirst for blood. They invariably wear chains, shackles, barbed flesh hooks, or manacles to show their captive state. Some have heavy chain leashes held by arch-devils or major demons. All chained angels have halos of pure black, and many have been flayed of their skin along one or more limbs._

**_Broken and Chained_**. These angels have been captured by fiends, tortured, and turned to serve darkness. A pack of chained angels is considered a status symbol among the servants of evil. A chained angel fights for the forces of evil as long as they remain chained, and this amuses demons and devils greatly.

**_Chance at Redemption_**. However, while their souls are tainted with the blood of innocents, in their hearts chained angels still hope to be redeemed, or at least to be given the solace of extinction. Any creature that kills a chained angel is given a gift of gratitude for the release of death, in the form of all the effects of a heroes' feast spell. If it cannot be redeemed, a chained angel is a storm of destruction.
