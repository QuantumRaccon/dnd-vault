## Description
---
_The frame of this withered demon's corpse barely fills the ashcolored plate armor that encases it. It carries a serrated khopesh sword in spiked gauntlets that hiss with violet smoke, and a horned ivory mask devoid of features is nailed to its face._

**_Children of Fiends_**. Long ago, a demon lord of shadow and deceit fell in love with a demon goddess of destruction. While consummating their romance at the base of a crater left by a meteor that destroyed a civilization, the two devised a plan to not merely slay their peers, but wholly expunge them from time itself, leaving only each other.
Shortly thereafter, the mask wights were conceived.

**_Rites of Annihilation_**. To create these undead, the lord of shadows stole the bodies of death knights from beneath the necropolis of an arch-lich. For her part, the goddess of the underworld then sacrificed a million condemned souls and drained their essence into ivory masksâ€”one for each fiend the couple sought to annihilate. Finally, the masks were hammered onto the knights with cold iron nails, and their armored husks were left at the bottom of the memory-draining River Styx for 600 years.
When they rose, the mask wights marched out into the planes to bury knowledge, conjure secrets, and erase their quarry from memory and history.

**_Ready for Betrayal_**. Kept secret from one another, though, the two each created an additional mask wight, a safeguard for in case betrayal should cross their lover's mind.
