## Description
---
_The people of Leng are hideous and malevolent, with small horns and goatlike legs they keep concealed beneath turbans, and mouths full of rows of serrated teeth, somewhat akin to sharks. They have a fondness for combining heavy leathers and bright silks in their robes, and they always go forth masked when leaving their chilled cities._

**_Dimensional Merchants_**. The folk of Leng are interplanar merchants and avid slavers, trading silks, rubies, and the manaencrusted stones of Leng for humanoid slaves. They sail between worlds in peculiar ships with split, lateen-rigged masts and rigging that howls like the damned in high winds. They tend a few pyramids in the deep deserts and are said to befriend void dragons, heralds of darkness, and other servants of the void.

**_A High Plateau_**. Leng is a forbidding plateau surrounded by hills and peaks. Its greatest city is Sarkomand, a place which some claim has fallen into ruin, and which others claim to have visited in living memory.

**_Love of Nets_**. When in combat, the folk of Leng use nets woven from the silk of their racial enemies, the spiders of Leng. They summon these nets from interdimensional storage spaces.
