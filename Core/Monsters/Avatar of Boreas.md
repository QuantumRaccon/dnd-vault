## Description
---
_Rime encrusts the wild, spiky hair and beard of this gaunt, savage.eyed man. He strides with an arrogant swagger, snapping blue eyes regarding those around him as an eagle regards the mouse. He carries a dragon-shaped horn, a spear of ice, and an enchanted longbow that shoots bolts of pure frozen air._

**_Lord of the North Wind_**. Known for creating mass destruction and death on a whim, Boreas is a devouring spirit of the north who frequently tampers with the mortal world. His worldly avatar resides in a palace of blue ice and white marble on Thule's highest peak, and he styles himself lord of all the North. Boreas suffers no disrespect and demands yearly tribute of gold, goods, and horses. He has a deep and abiding hatred of the three other Wind Lords.

**_Easily Angered_**. When displeased, he bombards his "subjects" with snow, lightning storms, and gale-force winds, or buries them in avalanches by blowing his greater horn of blasting. When particularly displeased, he sends his various servants to descend upon a tribe or settlement without mercy.

> [!INFO] Legends of Boreas
>All hail the Devourer, for tales and kennings of Boreas are as common as a spring gale or a winter's blast. Called the Hail Thrower, the Snowy Rager, and the Father of the Snow Mares, Boreas is said to have been one of four brothers who lived far to the south, before a bitter struggle between Boreas and his three younger brothers led to him cursing the others and leaving the to suffer forever in empty quarters of sand and dust, while he took the rich forests and cool northern climes for his own.
>Stories tell of that Boreas lives in a great tower in the Utmost North, served by frost giants, thuellai, and ice maidens. There he plots Ragnarok with Loki and the giants, but he has another wishâ€”to woo and win the hand of a worthy wife, and he is bold enough to woo two by turns, Oluffa, the Queen of the Frost Giants and Nicnevin, Fey Queen of Witches.
>His daughter, the Snow Queen Morrinn of Grokeheim, is not fond of this wild romance, and she strives to keep her father far from the Witch-Queen's affections and further still from Loki and the giants. To do this, she sometimes employs mortal heroes to steal a treasure from her father's tower, to rustle away with his finest winter wolves, or to bring sweet spring air into his court, thereby provoking him into a rage, and turning his careful wooing of powerful beauties into an occasion for raw tempers and abject apologies.
