## Description
---
>The serpentine body of the sanddrift drake blends in with the desert sands, its six legs giving it purchase on the canyon walls as it bursts from the ground to snatch its prey.

Found in the hottest deserts, the sanddrift drake is a cunning hunter that blends in with the burning sands.
**_Burrowing Hunter_**. The sanddrift drake hunts by hiding beneath the desert sand and ambushing its prey from below. A series of transparent lids protect the drake's eyes from the harsh light of the desert and the sand where it hides, leaving it with a clear view of approaching prey.

**_Paralytic Poison_**. The drake's bite holds a paralytic poison, which it uses to separate its prey from a group or herd.

>The fallen Fey Lord, Tarkun, has been known to capture and tame sanddrift drakes for use in his army. Tarkun's [[apaxrusl]] minions are also capable of gliding through the sands of the desert, making them the perfect warriors to ride upon the tamed drakes.
