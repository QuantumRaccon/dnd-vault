## Description
---
_This man of middle years, with black hair and flesh as white as ivory, wears black and purple clothes and a silvery crown set with emeralds. His feet are sheathed in black boots, and his arms and fingers are covered in rich gold and silver jewelry. He holds a skulltopped scepter._

Emperor Nicoforus the Pale rules the subterranean empire of the darakhul. Deep beneath the surface in lightless tunnels and vast chambers, the civilized ghouls of the empire carved glory from flesh and stone under Nicoforus' leadership. He led the empire to victory against the dark elves, and now that race is all but extinct in any territory the ghouls control.

**_Unexpected Courtesy_**. The ghouls are content to reside in the lightless depths beneath the earth for now, but the emperor muses about what prizes exist under the sky. Emperor Nicoforus has a soul of steel and hunger like the deepest chasms of the underworld. Despite his ambition, he is extremely civilized and urbane, treating even hated enemies with strict courtesy even up to the moment that he devours their bones.

**_Undead Nature_**. The emperor doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


**_The Ghoul Emperor's Lair_**. Emperor Nicoforus' lair is his palace in the center of the White City, the capital of the darakhul empire. He is attended by elite ghoul warriors of the Iron Legion, and his subjects hold him in divine esteem. Anyone who raises a hand against the emperor soon finds themselves opposed by an entire empire.
