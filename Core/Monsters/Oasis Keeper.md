## Description
---
>The large, sand-colored serpent lies in wait beneath the sands at the edge of the oasis, its large nostrils flaring above the sand. The barbed stinger on the end of its tail rests just below the water's surface.

Oasis keepers lurk within the waters of oases and secrete a toxin into them.
**_Peaceful Poison_**. Traveling caravans and animals that drink from oases inhabited by oasis keepers are lulled into lingering around them and provide an ample food supply for the oasis keepers. Settlements often form around such oases, and occasional disappearances are accepted as the norm.

**_Sand and Water Dwellers_**. Oasis keepers lurk by the edge of the water and wait for an opportune time to use their stingers. After they strike, they pull their meal to the water's depths to feast. Oasis keepers occasionally travel into underground rivers to mate, but they are otherwise fairly sedentary and solitary.
