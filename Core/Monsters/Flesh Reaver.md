## Description
---
_This pale, emaciated abomination crawls on four elongated, dissimilar limbs affixed to its inverted torso. Its long neck coils and slithers as its eyeless head searches for prey, accompanied by the sound of chattering teeth. Black ichor oozes from a stained hole at the base of its neck._

**_Terrifying Sight_**. A flesh reaver is a grotesque thing made from mismatched parts of the slain. Though it has no eyes, it searches its surroundings with other preternatural senses that unnerve even the most steadfast warrior. Its teeth chatter endlessly as it scours an area, the sound chilling the blood of its quarry.


**_Hounds of War_**. Undead nations have many soldiers among their ranks, and every army needs a way to hunt down its enemies. The flesh reaver's keen senses and agility make it perfect for this task. Necromancers and ghoul barons bind the flesh reavers with magical chains in small packs to hunt down and destroy their enemies.


**_Consuming Flesh_**. Like the ghouls it often serves, the flesh reaver is driven by an almost uncontrollable hunger, a slave to its need to feed on living flesh. Upon latching onto its prey, the flesh reaver releases a long, black, barbed tongue from the hole at the base of its neck that dissolves and devours the flesh of its victim.


**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The flesh reaver doesn't require air or sleep.
