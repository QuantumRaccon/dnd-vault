## Description
---
>Small volcanoes form, erupt, and subside on the skin of this large demon, surrounding her with the stench of sulfur and leaving ash in her wake.

Unceasing babble whines from the gaping maw of Duchess Alsikaya, the Screeching Mother of Volcanoes. The nauseating stench of sulfur surrounds her, and red-hot lava flows down her body from volcanic cinder cones seething in her flesh.
**_Eruptive Disposition_**. Duchess Alsikaya is antisocial and aggressive. Rather than grant—or even listen to—their requests, she prefers to dissolve petitioners in lava and poisonous fumes. Alsikaya's legendary temper erupts with little provocation, especially when forced into diplomacy. Clever supplicants bring Alsikaya a bard, songbird, or fey musician as tribute before a negotiation. Their songs calm Alsikaya for a time.

**_Volcanic Followers_**. Creatures with an affinity to volcanoes venerate the Screeching Mother, as do [[troll \|trolls]], some [[gargoyle \|gargoyles]], and debased dwarves. Alsikaya regularly employs cherufes to do her bidding on the Material Plane, speaking her needs through pools of bubbling magma. The rumbling and volcanic activity brought about by Alsikaya's words often results in cherufes receiving more tribute from the civilizations they subjugate, leaving even the most recalcitrant of cherufes willing to listen to her request.


> [!INFO] Duchess Alsikaya in Midgard
>Alsikaya's lair is the Scarred Palace, which looms over the city of Ahtesseri, the City of Flowering Fire. From there, she rules over a plane of choking smoke, sinuous rivers of lava, and stony ground—Urgennos, the Luminous Hell of Fire and Sulfur. Fiery demons and devils of all kinds make their home on this plane, though Alsikaya's palace is predominantly staffed with [[barbed devil \|barbed devils]] and [[fire imp \|fire imps]] (Creature Codex). For more information on the plane of Urgennos, see _Warlock #16: Eleven Hells_.
**_Alsikaya's Lair_**. Aliskaya's lair is in a huge, frequently-blackened palace of turrets, heavy walls, and deep-dug barracks. Her palace sits at the heart of a plane of fire and smoke, where she rules with an explosive temper.
