## Description
---
>The elegant gnomish noblewoman smiles, flashing dazzling white teeth in contrast to her rich blue hair, and moves with fluid grace past a mirror. As she passes the mirror, her reflection briefly shows old blood caked on her face.

Phylomara Gladrienne is mistress of the Court of Midnight Teeth, an influential and loyal vassal to the queen and king of the shadow fey courts. She is a refined and fashionable gnome, bedecked in fine silks and gleaming jewels that compliment her azure hair. She styles her locks elaborately and never quite the same way twice, setting trends among her courtiers. Beneath this veneer of civility and style, however, blood and secrets await.
Manicured lawns, incredibly lifelike statues, and bubbling fountains filled with inky midnight waters surround her home. String music drifts on the perpetual gloom, beckoning travelers to this oasis of lantern-dappled beauty.
**_Lady of the Blue Barbers_**. The gnome courtiers of Midnight Teeth who attend the mistress in her home also serve as her agents abroad. They call themselves the Blue Barbers, after their universally blue hair and their desire to bring style to all they meet. They serve as valets, barbers, art dealers, decorators, and stylists of all kinds. The Blue Barbers are polite, gregarious, and knowledgeable on a variety of topics, which they eagerly share while plying their trade.

**_Hunger for Secrets and Flesh_**. The mistress is perpetually ravenous for secrets and flesh. The Blue Barbers are such sparkling conversationalists and irresistible gossips because every scrap of information passes from their lips to their mistress' ears.
The feasts and banquets thrown at her court are legendary. They are nightly events, and the perfect opportunity to seek her favor. She knows much that is hidden and might be willing to part with her knowledge in trade, but those who cross her learn too late of the insatiable hunger for living flesh yawning beneath her refined exterior.


> [!INFO] The Blue Barbers in Midgard
>The Blue Barbers are a staple sight in the Free City of Zobeck in Midgard. They are chatty, blue-haired and bearded gnomes set up on Wharf Street, offering haircuts, shaves, styles, and wonderful conversation.
>The Blue Barbers are beginning to appear in other cities throughout the Crossroads region of Midgard and beyond, on the lookout for heroes of interest and skill who might one day be of use to their mistress.
>For more information on the Blue Barbers, see the _Zobeck Gazetteer_ and the _Midgard Worldbook_.
> [!INFO] Touch of Cold Iron
>Lords and ladies of the fey courts are timeless creatures, inured to many of the world's threats. A universal exception to this is weapons of [[cold iron weapon \|cold-wrought iron]]. This metal undoes the very fabric of a fey creature's life as it blights their ageless flesh. A cold iron weapon is treated as magical when used against any fey creature, and is the only weapon with any hope of harming the most powerful fey lords and ladies. However, cold iron weapons are difficult to construct. The skill and material required to produce such a weapon doubles its price or adds 100 gp to the cost, whichever is more. Finding a smith with the skill to make a durable weapon without the aid of fire is always difficultâ€”and finding one with the courage to anger the fey courts may be even harder.
**_The Mistress' Lair_**. The mistress resides within the Court of Midnight Teeth, a lavish manse of marble and silver in the Plane of Shadow. Giltframed mirrors adorn almost every wall. Goblin servants wait on gnome courtiers who wear outrageous, elaborate cobalt blue hairstyles.
When encountered in her lair, the mistress has a challenge rating of 16 (15,000 XP).
