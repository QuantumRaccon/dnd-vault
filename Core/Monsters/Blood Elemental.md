## Description
---
_A swirling, bubbling, ambulatory glob of blood the size of a hogshead cask lurches forward._

Native to a lake of churning blood on an abyssal plane, blood elementals aren't typical elementals.

**_Drawn to Life_**. A blood elemental is drawn to movement and absorbs whatever living creatures it finds, increasing its size and power in the process. Though feeding is not necessary to sustain themselves, blood elementals, over time, will shrink unless they consume living creatures. However, their need for prey is relatively slightâ€”once a week to maintain their size.


**_Blood Summoning_**. Offerings of blood and blood magic spells draw blood elementals from their planar homes, with the proper ritual. They also sometimes follow in the wake of certain demons and devils, devouring entire bodies in a matter of hours. When a blood elemental feeds, it first removes all liquids, then liquefies and consumes the remaining flesh, and finally sucks out the marrow, leaving behind only dry, reddish bones.


**_Elemental Nature_**. The blood elemental doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


> [!INFO] Blood Elementals in Midgard
>Perhaps not surprising, blood elementals are commonly found in the Blood Hell and in the rites of the blood mages of Naa'Kesh and similar blood cults. Blood mages seem able to retain tiny blood elementals as familiars or guardians of some kind, though the exact nature of their bond is a mystery they guard jealously. Many small sects of blood cultists seem to learn the secret, leading some savants to believe that this knowledge is freely shared by priests of Marena and similar dark gods. For more information on blood magic and spells, see the "Fifth Edition Appendix" in the Midgard Worldbook.
