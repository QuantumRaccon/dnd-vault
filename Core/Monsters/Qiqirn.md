## Description
---
>This strange dog is hairless except for the thick, dark fur that runs along its bony, ridged back.

**_Arctic Legends_**. Oral histories of the north are rich with tales of the qiqirn. The tales say they are drawn to mankind's warm hearths and homes and that the sounds of music and mirth enrage them. The stories note that qiqirn are jealous of dogs and that jealousy leads them to kill canines whenever they can. More than a few tales are told of qiqirn that have foolishly become trapped while trying to get at a settlement's sled dogs. Most importantly, northern children are told that a qiqirn can be driven off by shouting its name at it.

**_Afraid of Civilization_**. Feared as they are by northern communities, qiqirn fear those people in turn. When threatened by civilized folk, qiqirn are quick to flee. When this occurs, a qiqirn often returns by night to steal the food or livestock it was previously denied. When qiqirn attacks have driven an entire community to hunt it, the monster leaves the region for easier hunting grounds.

**_Spirit Dog_**. A qiqirn's fear of civilization is built on the basis of self-preservation. The qiqirn is an unwilling conduit for souls of the damned that aren't strong enough to travel to the afterlife. These spirits steadily torment the qiqirn, causing it pain and infusing it with necrotic power as they seek their own respite. As the qiqirn spends more time around civilization, it accrues more damned souls. Much as a fiend transforms to higher forms as it devours souls, a qiqirn that lives long enough or spends enough time around civilization undergoes a painful transformation from its constant contact with the growing number of tormented souls. These qiqirn seek to destroy all they encounter, sharing their pain with others. Scholars speculate the power of the spirits would eventually kill the [[tormented qiqirn]] if the creature lost the ability to offload the pain coursing from the other side of the veil.


> [!INFO] Curing a Qiqirn
>Qiqirn live in remote arctic regions to avoid excessive contact with humanoids, but they can't resist warm hearths and the easy prey in livestock pens. No matter how much a qiqirn tries to avoid civilization, eventually it accrues enough souls and becomes a [[tormented qiqirn]]. Though qiqirn can never be freed of the quirk that draws damned souls to them, they can be freed of the souls burdening them by putting those souls to rest. Ankou, in particular, are adept at releasing the qiqirn of its burden of souls, and [[ankou soul herald \|ankou soul heralds]] (Creature Codex) often assign [[ankou soul seeker \|soul seekers]] (Creature Codex) to areas inhabited by qiqirn to ensure the souls get the proper respite and that the qiqirn doesn't become tormented.
>A [[tormented qiqirn]] can be freed of its burden of souls only by an [[ankou soul herald]] (Creature Codex) or a [[wish]] spell. If freed of its burden, a tormented qiqirn shrinks back into its standard form.
