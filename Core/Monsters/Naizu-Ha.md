## Description
---
>The old fable How Nuizamo Lost His Knife suggests every blade that has been used to kill is actually a naizu-ha in its native form. This is untrue, but the naizu-ha enjoy the myth and perpetuate it whenever possible.

**_Daggers Personified_**. The naizu-ha are the act of violence perpetrated by small blades given form. Dealings with naizu-ha are fraught with danger. Initially presumed to be good allies in battle, it was quickly discovered that they couldn't be controlled in a pitched combat and eagerly lashed out at anything that came into reach. Most often, naizu-ha are summoned to assassinate specific targets.

**_Impartial Betrayers_**. A naizu-ha has no loyalty to anything but its own desire for blood and pain. If dispatched to kill someone, a naizu-ha can be coerced to switch sides with a promise that their new task will involve more violence than the current job does. They have no patience for subtle work or trickery that involves more than a quick feint. A favorite tactic of naizu-ha is to fulfill a contract, collect whatever payment has been agreed upon, and immediately murder the initial contractor.

**_Bloody Biers_**. To summon a naizu-ha, the blood of no fewer than three humanoids must be splashed on a stand forged of fused blades. If the petitioner uses their own blood in the ceremony, they have advantage on any ability checks they make to treat with the naizu-ha. Immortal Spirit Nature. The kami doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.

> [!INFO] Kami in Midgard
>Kami are the small gods of the Winter Isles. Each kami is the spirit of something tangible, be it an ideal, an emotion, or a specific item or location. A kami can be summoned to the Material Plane by any creature that builds it a shrine and offers suitable tribute. Less majestic kami, such as a [[gorao-ka]], require only a small shrine and a gift of any size, so long as it is freely given. More important kami may require a magnificent monument as well as some form of grand tribute.
