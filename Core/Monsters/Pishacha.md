## Description
---
_This ghoul-like demon has blue-black skin covered in bulging red veins that glow like embers. A long, lascivious tongue snakes forth from a mouth filled with jagged teeth._

**_Cursed by the Gods_**. Originating in eastern lands, pishacha are created when the souls of the greedy and lustful are deemed too wicked to be reincarnated by the gods. Unable to redeem themselves, the pishacha are cursed to remain on the Material Plane and feed on the living.


**_Graveyard Dwellers_**. Pishacha demons haunt remote places where they can lure a living creature to its doom. They often share space with ghouls, and some pishacha can be found dwelling near darakhul settlements. Those living near a pishacha lair make offerings of rice at the crossroads on holy days to appease the demons and keep them away.


**_Bloodthirsty and Cruel_**. Pishacha seek to spread fear and mayhem among the living. They seek to possess humanoid bodies, driving their victims insane from the inside out.
