## Description
---
_With a dark beard and fiery eyes, the master of Demon Mountain has long been a figure of terror to those who live within sight of his castle. Some say he is the dark, twisted son of Baba Yaga and an unnamed lord of the Abyss. Demons, certainly, bow and speak politely to him, and the least of them jump to his command._

**_Father of Fiends_**. The Master of Demon Mountain is a creature of lascivious appetites and the father of dozens of tieflings—and, at the same time, his family is a source of great pride to him. They are the foundation of an empire, and his brood is loyal and as ambitious as their father. They serve him ably in distant corners of the world, where he sends them to forge alliances through marriages or arcane trades.

**_A Bound Legend_**. He remains a figure of legend as well as a political force. An expert demon binder, his power is terrifying even at a distance. But wielding worldly power and extending his influence is merely an entertaining game for him. His real goal is to reach immortality—although first he must break the pacts binding him to his dark manor.
