## Description
---
As cold as the land they inhabit, metee-kolen-ol were practitioners of magic who succumbed to corruption at the hands of the sinister gods of the frozen wastes. Now they serve their masters as faithful lieutenants, dispassionately carrying out divine wishes and enforcing divine will. Communities who anger the masters of the metee-kolen-ol sometimes find themselves the targets of savage acts carried out by once-familiar faces, now turned to unfeeling pawns of merciless gods. Those under a metee-kolen-ol's command live in fear of the long marches and hard labors they may be ordered to endure. The metee-kolen-ol never suffer from the cold and are indifferent to negligible losses.
