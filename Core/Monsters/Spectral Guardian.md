## Description
---
_A luminous green mist swirls into the form of an ancient warrior. Dented armor and a ragged cloak enshroud the warrior's skeletal body, and its grinning skull leers out from an open helm._

**_Worn Finery_**. Composed of faintly glowing green vapor, the spectral guardian is a skeletal being encased in ancient armor or noble's finery. The cloth is worn and tattered, spiraling away into mist at the edges, and the creature glides with the faintest whisper of sound like a mournful moan from far away.

**_Eternal Disgrace_**. The spectral guardian is the spirit of an ancient warrior or noble, bound to serve in death as it failed to do in life. A broken oath, an act of cowardice, or a curse laid down by the gods for a terrible betrayal leaves an indelible mark on a soul.
After the cursed creature's death, its spirit rises, unquiet, in a place closely related to its disgrace. Compelled by the crushing weight of its deeds, the spectral guardian knows no rest or peace, and viciously snuffs out all life that intrudes upon its haunt.

**_Undead Nature_**. A spectral guardian doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
