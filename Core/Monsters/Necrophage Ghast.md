## Description
---
_This creature's stench precedes it, suggesting a shambling monstrosity; but, the keen look of intelligence in its eye and arcane sigils on its arm promise a more cunning and dangerous foe._

**_An Erudite Threat_**. Unlike typical ghouls and ghasts, the necrophage ghast possesses a keen intelligence that thirsts for arcane knowledge, especially the magic that can return the dead to life and force it to serve.


**_Learn, then Conquer_**. The necrophage ghast seeks out knowledge, often spending days, weeks, or even months in solitary research to track down and learn a new bit of arcane necromantic magic. Afterwards, they are eager to put their newfound knowledge into practice. All their research is for naught if they cannot gather enough corpses to perform their experiments.


**_Arcane Stench_**. Through careful experimentation, necrophage ghasts have engineered their natural stench into a magical aura that causes those with weak constitutions to be more susceptible to their arcane magic.


**_Hungry Dead Nature_**. The necrophage ghast doesn't require air or sleep.
