## Description
---
_What appears to be a mated pair of animals changes shape into two celestials. Their humanoid forms still bear some marks of their animal selves. They move in perfect harmony._

Fidele angels form from souls so devoted to each other that their love transcends death.

**_Friends to Lovers_**. Fideles are charged with exhorting mortals to respect the bonds of partnership. They assist lovers facing obstacles and punish the enemies of love. Where there is a conflict between two cultures' laws in love, they prefer the result that keeps the beloved together.

**_Quiet Diplomats_**. They prefer diplomacy to force and, despite the urgency of love, they've been known to live secretly among mortals for years or decades while waging quiet campaigns against social mores and cultural norms that keep love from achieving its full potential.

**_Rage of Passion_**. When love is denied, or when kept apart, fidele angels can enter towering rages and an anger born of passionate righteousness.
