## Description
---
_These twisted dryads have been turned into vampiric monstrosities by undead warlocks and vampiric experiments._

**_Charred Dryads_**. With burnt and blackened skin, burnt twigs for hair, and clawed hands and feet that resemble burnt and twisted roots, mavkas seem scorched and even frail. Pupil-less red eyes gleam in their eye sockets with a hellish green flame.

**_Death Riders_**. All mavkas ride nightmare mounts as fearsome raiders, often snatching victims up into the saddle, never to be seen again. They despise and trample foot soldiers as peasants unworthy of attention.

**_Hag Killers_**. Mavkas are the mortal enemies of red hags, who call these undead horrors "greenbanes."

> [!INFO] Mavkas in Midgard
>Mavkas were once three dryad sisters named Mica, Anthelia, and Saramantha. After his conquest of Morgau, the Black Prince Lucan had the dryads and their trees killed, and then raised the corpses as powerful undead. His warlocks bonded the new undead with nightmares instead of trees to complete their corruption.
>These three sisters have since spawned many more such undead fey, and they some serve the Black Prince as wives or concubines while others pursue their own ends, destroying vampires, laying waste to whole villages, and seeking power in the Shadow Realm. The mavkas occasionally refer to one another as "sister-wives."
