## Description
---
_A three-foot-long centipede with a mottled carapace lunges from the undergrowth. Its front limbs end in sharp claws, while its mandibles drip venom._

The rageipede is not commonly found in urban landscapes, though there have been reports of small forest hamlets becoming feeding grounds for the creature. The rageipede is commonly known as the fury worm due to its peculiar hunting methods.

**_Fury's Kiss_**. The bite of the rageipede holds powerful mind-altering venom that causes even the most conditioned individuals to fall into a mindless rage, attacking anyone or anything in sight.

**_Patient Stalkers_**. The rageipede's primary food source is carrion left in the wake of its enraged victims. The rageipede lies in wait for potential victims to pass within range, utilizing the element of surprise to bite. After biting its victim, the creature typically retreats and hides in nearby underbrush or tree cover, waiting to claim its spoils.

**_Rageipede Victims_**. Victims go on a rampage, killing and destroying everything in sight. Once the wave of rage passes, the victims typically suffer no lingering effects. However, the victims are left with the memories of their deeds, which often proves worse than the alternative.
