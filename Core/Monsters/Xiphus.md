## Description
---
_A faint ticking and a blur of light and limbs almost too fast to see are the only warnings that trouble is coming._

These tiny beings have silver or white hair and bronze skin that shimmers no matter how much or little light is present. They have tall, pointed ears and slightly slanted eyes. A contraption of gears, pistons, and hourglasses filled with red sand spin and whir where the xiphus' heart should be.

**_Gear-Hearted_**. Clockwork-enhanced fey, the xiphus were once [[quickstep \|quickstep]], but, long ago, they gave up on being merely flesh. When a xiphus comes of age, it undergoes an intense ritual in which its heart is replaced with a clockwork apparatus that beats like a heart and grants the fey power over time.

**_Brotherly Rivals_**. They consider the quicksteps somewhat dim-witted for not making the same adjustment, and the two speedy fey rarely get along well for any length of time.

**_Triple Speech_**. A xiphus speaks so rapidly that often it is not understood on a first passâ€”and so most xiphus will repeat themselves at least once and often twice when they are speaking to "the slow ones."
