## Description
---
_Dwarfing even the largest mammoth, the beast lumbers forward, its enormous tusks swaying with the rhythm of its thunderous footfalls._

The largest oliphaunts stand just over 30 feet tall, two to three times the size of a typical elephant. Males often have one pair of large tusks and a pair of shorter tusks known as tushes, which have no marrow inside. Female tusks are enormous, with the outside pair often being a few feet shorter, but no less deadly. Oliphaunts that live in hot, dry climates often have very little body hair, while those that live in colder climates will be heavily furred, similar to a mammoth.

**_Titanic Mounts_**. While tribes of humanoids have been known to breed and raise tame oliphaunts to act as beasts of burden, giants are also well known for having oliphaunt mounts. Humanoids tend to build structures of wood and canvas to sit upon the gigantic beasts, while a single giant may ride an oliphaunt bareback or with some form of saddle.
