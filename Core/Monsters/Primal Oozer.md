## Description
---
>This nightmarish quadruped has many wolf-like features—including its physique, its powerful claws, and its lupine countenance—but its hairless skin is a thick layer of bluish-white slime. Four tentacles ending in barbed tips protrude from its jawline, and its eyes glow red. It makes a sickening gurgling sound when it growls.

**_Natives of the Swamp_**. Primal oozers are amphibious natives to swamps and wetlands. They often make their lairs in the root systems of massive trees where the soil beneath has been washed away. They can also be found in flooded ruins, wet riversides, or in the water itself. They are savage, deadly, and delight in killing.

**_Kinship with Mydnari_**. Primal oozers have a natural kinship with [[mydnari]]. The mydnari admire the oozers for their natural slime, which most other creatures find repugnant. The oozers like the attention and care they receive from the mydnari and value the mydnari settlements as safe havens in the dangerous depths of the world. A pack of primal oozers might gather around and protect a strong mydnari that treats them well, but they might just as easily turn on the oozing humanoid if treated poorly or if their protection isn't properly respected, usually through frequent meals and praise.

**_Ooze-Spreading Tentacles_**. The barbed tentacles on the primal oozer's jaw latch on to creatures it bites and inject an oozing disease into the oozer's victims. This disease slowly liquefies the victim's skin, turning it ooze-like. Eventually, the disease melts the creature completely into a new [[ochre jelly]]. Mydnari often collect these "newborn" ochre jellies as hosts for their young.
