## Description
---
_This squat little man has long limbs and skin the color of coal, and the backs of its hands and tops of its feet are covered in thick hair. Its face seems a bit too wide for its head, and its eyes gleam a little too brightly in the pale light._

Pomberos are strange tricksters, born of shadows in the wild. At rest, they tend to adopt a squatting posture, which accentuates their too-long limbs. They shun bright light, though it doesn't harm them, and seek out shadows and half-light. For this reason, they are known as the Night People.

**_Joy of Trespassing_**. Pomberos take delight from creeping into places where they don't belong and stealing interesting objects. A pombero's lair is littered with trinkets, both commonplace and valuable. The blame for all manner of misfortune is laid at the pombero's hairy feet.

**_Hatred of Hunters_**. In contrast to their larcenous ways, pomberos take great umbrage over the killing of animals and the destruction of trees in their forests. Birds are particularly beloved pets, and they enjoy mimicking bird songs and calls most of all. Villagers in areas near pombero territory must be careful to treat the animals and trees with respect, and killing birds usually is a strong taboo in such areas.
