## Description
---
Cousin to the beholder, the big green eye lurks in dark hallways and shadows of the darker corners of an area. It waits patiently to exercise its non-merciful attacks on any prey nearby. It feeds on its own evil.

**_Lairs_**. The big green eye can share lairs with beholders, provided there is detente or solidarity among the creatures. The big green eye, however, has no lair actions of its own.
**_Tactics_**. The big green eye enacts its Blue Shield at will. It can turn it off and on as long as it still retains the shield. The shield gives off a blue glow, so the big green eye may want to remove it when trying to hide. The big green eye uses its rays in combination to try and confuse, paralyze, frighten, and/or wound its prey appropriately.
