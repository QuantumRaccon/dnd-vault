## Description
---
_A twelve-foot-tall granite carving of a great warrior lunges to attack._

Fractal golems are usually composed of granite. They are thin, long of limbs, and intricately carved. While looking like menacing hulks, these constructs are able trackers and lurkers.

**_Programmed Hunters_**. Fractal golems are often used as bodyguards or arcane bounty hunters, knocking their quarry unconscious and bringing it back to their masters. A fractal golem's creator can imprint the golem with a specified individual the creator wants the construct to capture.


**_Exploding Duplicates_**. Like other golems, fractal golems are nearly impervious to spells and ordinary weapons. However, when they would ordinarily be destroyed, they explode and split into smaller parts. Travelers fighting what they might have mistaken for an ordinary stone construct could end up fighting eight tiny golems, each with the power of the original. Once split, a fractal golem can't be healed or returned to its previous form.


**_Construct Nature_**. A golem doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
