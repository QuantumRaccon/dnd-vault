## Description
---
_In the lightless depths beneath the ground, an empire of devouring ambition grows and plots and dreams. They call themselves the People, but the people of the surface world call them the Lords Subterranean, the Ghoul Imperium, or simply the Empire of the Ghouls. Their cities lie out of sight, their agents infiltrate the underworlds of a score of surface cities, and their goals know no limits. To them, if you are not a member of the People, you are food._
