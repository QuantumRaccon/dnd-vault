## Description
---
_Watching with many rows of eyes, this mantis creature strikes with slashing claws and recurved barbs dripping with venom._

**_Dimensional Travelers_**. The clandestine xhkarsh are beings from another cosmic cycle. Their devices and armor are incomprehensible to—possibly even incompatible with—creatures of this reality.

**_Tamper with Fate_**. The xhkarsh utilize their fate-altering powers to distort personal histories and manipulate mortal destinies like puppeteers. By doing this, they realign the universe toward their own, esoteric ends—but what those ends might be, only the xhkarsh know.

**_Foes of Skein Witches_**. Skein witches and valkyries are perpetual enemies of the xhkarsh, whom they accuse of perverting the proper run of destiny for both great heroes and ordinary folk.
