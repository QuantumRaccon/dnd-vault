## Description
---
>This creature is round and hovers without the aid of wings. Its skin is a deep red color, with a leathery toughness and texture. It has three forward-facing, segmented eyes and a protruding, bloodstained proboscis.

**_Unknown Origins_**. The origins of the wardu are unknown, though scholars speculate that they came from the Plateau of Leng. It is said they were introduced to the Material Plane as a result of an ill-fated expedition by a group of wizards to the edges of the multiverse. The wizards were attacked by a horde of wardu who followed them through the planar rift they created to return home. Although the rift was sealed immediately, dozens of the wardu were trapped on the Material Plane and have since reproduced for numerous generations.

**_Blood Drinkers_**. Wardu are blood drinkers, and it is the only way they absorb sustenance. They are able to attack and gain sustenance from any creature that has blood, no matter the type. Their hunger drives them to attack most creatures they encounter, though they are smart enough to discern the difference between a potential food source and a more powerful creature not worth provoking.

**_Magic Hunters_**. Wardus have a thirst for the blood of spellcasters and even put themselves at risk to obtain that tastiest of treats. Drinking arcane-infused blood has imbued the wardu with some magical power. It can channel this power through its central eye, but the segmented nature of its eye causes the magic to become unstable and scatter as it passes through the eye's facets.
