## Description
---
>A plump, wingless drake with golden scales and glowing amber eyes lounges on a pile of treasure. When it opens its crooked mouth, molten gold drips from its jaws.

**_Avarice Personified_**. Hoard drakes are perhaps the most avaricious and lazy of all dragonkind, spending their days lying on huge mounds of copper, silver, and gold pieces, rarely—if ever—venturing out of their lairs. Hoard drakes feed irregularly, gorging themselves on metals, minerals, and the occasional dwarf or goat when hunger finally gets the better of them. Hoard drakes are almost as vain as they are greedy and meticulously clean their scales to a polished gleam that matches their golden treasure. Hoard drakes lust after the hoards of true dragons and sometimes attack small dragons to steal their treasure or take over their lairs.

**_Robbers Beware_**. Strangely, hoard drakes are docile creatures that are open to conversation with visitors. However, hoard drakes are roused to terrible anger when even the smallest portion of their treasure is taken. At such times, a hoard drake leaves its lair to relentlessly pursue the thief, not resting until its treasure is reclaimed and the offending party is slain and eaten. A hoard drake never gives up any part of its hoard unless threatened with certain death. Even then, it doesn't rest until the indignity it has suffered has been repaid in full.
