## Description
---
_A giant hornet with a yellow and red body, silver wings, and a black stinger buzzes angrily. Honeycomb-shaped bulbous tumors grow on its body._

**_Deadly Jungle Hunters_**. The fleshpod hornet makes it home in the deepest, darkest jungles. It eats the sweet fruits growing there but has learned to drink blood as well. Three or four fleshpod hornets can bring down even the largest jungle beasts. Very few people live long enough to describe a fleshpod hornet hive, as the beasts attack on sight.


**_Honeycomb Tumors_**. Fleshpod hornets reproduce through their venomous stings. The eggs of the hornet are delivered with the poison, infecting a living creature. Within minutes, the eggs implanted in the victim form a lotus-pod tumor in its flesh. Immediately the eggs begin to hatch, feeding on the victim's body. Within 24 hours, the dominant larva reaches a form that can survive on its own. It bursts from the tumor and flies off.
The fleshpod hornet is not immune to its own tumors. While the hornet does not succumb to its own poison, it often bears several tumors, carrying its own eggs. The gestation period for the hornet's own eggs, however, are much slower than those eggs incubating in a victim.
