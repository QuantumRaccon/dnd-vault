## Description
---
>Filthy rags partially conceal this walking mosquito's form. The hands poking out of its rags end in needle-like fingers, which resemble the proboscis on the creature's head.

**_Abyssal Swamp Dwellers_**. Culicoid demons make their home in a fetid layer of the Abyss where they serve demon lords who value insects. When they travel to the Material Plane, they make themselves at home in insect-infested marshes.

**_Buzzing and Itching_**. Though a culicoid's wings are suitably large for its size, they produce a high-pitched drone. Their wingbeats don't stand out from regular insects, making them difficult to detect. The culicoid's filthy proboscis induces an irritating rash that forces its victims to ignore all else to scratch the rash.

**_Friend to Mosquitos_**. The culicoid demon can communicate with mosquitos, [[stirge \|stirges]], and other similar creatures, such as [[anophiloi]] (Creature Codex). These creatures cannot drink blood from the demon, but they innately feel a connection to it. The culicoid surrounds itself with swarms of the insects and uses its sensitivity to the smell of blood to lead its allies to feasts.
