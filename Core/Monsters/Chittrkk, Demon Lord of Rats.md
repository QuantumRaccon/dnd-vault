## Description
---
_Puffing on his faintly screaming pipe, the foul creature seemed almost contemplative as he disemboweled the humans, one by one. The air around him was thick with plague, with nibbling decay, and with the greasy shine of hideous dreams._

The demon lord is an upright and partly-humanoid large, redeyed rat. His grey-white fur is sometimes spattered with offal and flecked with blood; other times, he is groomed constantly by swarms of ordinary rats. Chittr'k'k's tail is tipped with a strange greenish fire. His front paws are long-fingered in the manner of rats, fully capable of holding and manipulating wands, scrolls, and other objects. He has long gold incisors, a short snout, and large ears (often ornamented with black or golden rings). He often smokes a magical pipe filled with mortal souls, drawing necrotic energy from this unhallowed vessel.

**_Cunning and Malicious_**. Chittr'k'k finds human weakness amusing and delights in cruelty. While still given to unbridled destruction, he is sometimes more cunning than other demon lords. He is able to destroy a crop or a city with equal joy. He justifies this as "vengeance for my brethren"â€”for all rats are his worshippers and slaves.


**_Devourer of Souls_**. Chittr'k'k's power comes in part from eating entire legions of mortal souls, and he dreams of attaining godhood through the devouring of demons. [[Rattok \|Rattok demons]] are said to be his creations.


**_Lord of Shadows_**. Chittr'k'k keeps a vast network of spies in the mortal world. All red-eyed rats are his servants, chittering their knowledge of blood, sacrifice, and misery to their dark lord. Chittr'k'k uses this information to give his followers greater reach, to destroy granaries, to starve entire nations, and to spread disease and misery everywhere his long-fingered claws reach.


**_Lord of Shadows_**. Chittr'k'k's lair is a vast realm of tunnels and dank caverns with thousands, if not millions, of rats, ratfolk, rattok demons and other horrors, a noisy place of constant squeals and skittering filled with the rank smells of blood, offal, and sweat. It is filled with snarling creatures preying on one another in its narrow, bone-strewn passages. Its only illumination comes from unholy sigils and territorial markings made in multi-colored, pale luminous ink.
