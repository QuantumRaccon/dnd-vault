## Description
---
_With skin stretched like vellum over wizened limbs, a desiccated humanoid form clad in splendid regalia emerges from a funerary tower. Suddenly, the air becomes so dry as to make the eyes sting and lips crack. The imposing figure has yellow points of light for eyes._

**_Cold Plateau Mummies_**. The people of the cold, rainless, mountain plateaus take advantage of their dry climes to mummify their honored dead, but without the embalming and curing of the corpse practiced in hotter lands. To preserve the knowledge and the place of their ancestors in the afterlife, their dead remain among them as counsellors and honorees on holy days.

**_Undead Judges_**. The mallqui are not seen as malevolent, though at times they are severe judges against transgressors of their culture's ideals.

**_Icons of Growth_**. Through their ability to draw the very moisture from the air, they are seen as conduits to the fertility of the earth. "Mallqui" also means "sapling" in the language of the people who create them.
