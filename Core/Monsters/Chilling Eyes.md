## Description
---
Clothed in tattered clothes with a cruel sneer etched upon its face, the undead horror that is the chilling eyes was created by gods of evil and chaos. It takes delight in ruin and corruption. These irreverent creatures are bent upon leading the pure and righteous into evil and completely destroying those who do not follow their malevolent and sadistic orders.

**_Moral Corruptors_**. A chilling eyes keeps its skeletal form covered in a ragged, hooded cloak as it first approaches a victim. It may appear to two friends walking down a dark highway and demand that one of them kill the other, or else both will die, or it may order a pious cleric to betray her religion. In any case, if the victim shows any form of resistance, the chilling eyes reveals its true nature by moving the hood aside to show its true visage: a skull with two shining gems, one blue and one black, glittering in the sockets where one would expect eyes. It strikes magical fear in its victims until they yield to its twisted desire, or freezes them to death if they cannot be corrupted. Should a chilling eyes be overpowered, it flees to the Ethereal Plane.
**_Returned Worshippers_**. Chilling eyes are creations of evil gods. Whenever such a deity fancies it, they may send the soul of one of their most morally corrupt and wicked worshippers back to the mortal coil to inhabit a skeletal corpse. Should a chilling eyes be destroyed, its gem-eyes lose their magical properties, though each is still worth 2,000 gp.
