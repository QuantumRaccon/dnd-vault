## Description
---
_The domovoi enjoy violence and bonebreaking; this makes them useful to more delicate creatures that need enforers._

**_Long Armed Bruisers_**. Domovoi resemble nothing so much as large, stony goblins, with oversized heads and leering grins, and with mossy beards as well as massive shoulders and forearms. Their large limbs give them reach and powerful slam attacks.

**_Abandoned Servants_**. The domovoi were the portal guards and house lackeys of the elvish nobility, and some were left behindâ€”some say on purpose.

**_Debt Collectors_**. These smirking stragglers seek work as tireless sentinels and fey button men, collecting debts for criminal syndicates. They can use alter self and invisibility at will, and they delight in frustrating the progress of would-be thieves and tomb robbers. They enjoy roughing up weaker creatures with their powerful, stony fists.

> [!INFO] Domovoi in Midgard
>The domovoi are ancient survivors, and they have outlived empires. They now have a certain sense of ownership of ancient places, and they are most commonly found in the ruins of Old Valera and Old Thorn, as well as the vast necropoli of Spintarra and Siwal. The Siwalese fey are sandier in appearance and have beards of rope and twine. These desert domovoi are known as "pa'athara" in Siwalese.
