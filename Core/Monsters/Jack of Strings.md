## Description
---
>Clad in fine clothes of black and red, the tall, slim figure steps forward. With a clawed hand grasping a crossbar, it makes its eyeless marionette dance. A chuckle of cruel delight escapes its fanged maw as a nearby observer suddenly rises and spasmodically mimics the dance.

**_Court Entertainers and Punishers_**. A jack of strings uses its collection of marionettes to amuse shadow fey courts. It is adept at tailoring its performances to the crowd, switching effortlessly between charming plays, ribald performances, satirical pantomimes, and terrifying tales. During these performances, the jack of strings can take control of a creature in the audience to enact justice in the form of humiliation, torture, or even death. The jack is sometimes hired by fey nobility to enact such justice on rivals.

**_Uncanny Valley_**. The jack of strings takes control of its victims by establishing a link between the victim and one of its marionettes. When it establishes the link, the marionette becomes lifelike while the jack's victim takes on a wooden appearance. The puppet gains the victim's eyes, which disappear from the victim's face.

**_Masters of Puppets_**. Jacks of strings have several marionettes at their disposal. Aside from the first, which it painstakingly crafts itself, the jack's puppets derive from victims who perish while linked to the jack's puppet. Jacks harvest their prey in the mortal realm under the guise of a traveling entertainer and typically target people who won't be missed.
