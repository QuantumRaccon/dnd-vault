## Description
---
Tosculi warriors are overseers of work crews and battle groups of drones, directing activities and relaying commands from higher up in the hive mind. They are entirely subservient to the hive-queen's orders, but if ordered to act independently or to follow their own best judgment, they're capable of doing so. Warriors are almost never encountered without drones, and tower over them. They stand 4 to 5 feet tall and weigh up to 70 pounds.

**_Host Finders_**. The warriors' most important role in the hive, however, is procuring live hosts for tosculi eggs to hatch in. Creatures paralyzed by warriors are brought to the queen's chamber to have eggs implanted in them. An egg hatches in 1d6 weeks, and the ravenous larva devours its still-living (but mercifully unconscious) host.
