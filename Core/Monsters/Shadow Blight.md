## Description
---
_The stump of a blackened, frostbitten conifer stands upright on six leg-like roots and scuttles sideways like an arboreal hermit crab. Inky shadows fill a hollow near the base of the stump._

**_Born of Vampires_**. When a vampire becomes a crimson mist (see page 67), the terrified, bestial essence of the vampire initially flees and hides as it attempts to regain its senses. The mist lurks in the shadow of a tall tree in the icy northern lowlands and devours tree-dwelling insects and small animals until it is strong enough to once again hunt. The tree, weakened by the necrotic energy coming off the strengthening crimson mist, often succumbs to frostbite, animating the next sunset as a shadow blight.

**_Spreading Parasite_**. The shadow blight longs to spread the shadow that animates it to other dead trees. It also tries to find a door to the Plane of Shadows, allowing it to exist in secluded darkness forever. It is willing to slaughter anyone who prevents it from satisfying its desires.

**_Red Flowering_**. Shadow blights are sometimes cultivated by vampires, liches, or necromancers as particularly loathsome guardians. When they kill a living creature, they briefly flower. These blossoms resemble a pinkish dogwood or, in some climates, a flowering plum tree.
