## Description
---
>A large cloud composed of tiny glowing sparks of fire floats silently through the air.

**_Origin of Planar Instability_**. Radiant spark swarms form when the border lands between the Plane of Fire and the Upper Planes experience some sort of instability. This instability might be caused by a regional anomaly, war between the gods themselves, magical upheaval, or some other calamity. Thousands of radiant sparks are created at once in massive conflagrations of radiant energy. They are then left to wander the planes alone. These creatures are most often found in the border lands between planes, but they have been known to appear in the Material Plane after accessing it through magical portals. They seldom wander back to their planes of origin and are almost always destroyed at some point during their eternal wanderings.

**_Hunger for Magic_**. Radiant spark swarms are drawn to magic for reasons that aren't fully understood, for they can neither use it, nor do they truly devour it. Instead, when they sense powerful magic nearby, they instinctually move toward it, as though its very presence is comforting to them. As creatures that are neither particularly intelligent nor evil, their interest in the living usually has to do with the magic spellcasters carry, which draws the sparks close. Unfortunately, the owner of the magic that drew them is often caught in the midst of the swarm, which is inherently harmful.

**_Elemental Nature_**. A radiant spark swarm doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
