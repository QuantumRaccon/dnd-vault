## Description
---
_A giant shark within a huge fishbowl circles a myriad of shells, a small castle, and a treasure chest._

**_Bizarre Curiosity_**. A shark on dry land may not be very threatening, but a shark that shares its life force with a massive ooze is a different beast. It draws in its prey with the promise of treasure.

**_Endless Appetite_**. The two monsters share a symbiotic attachment and would be doomed without one another. The shark and ooze both gain sustenance from living tissue the ooze gathers as the shark swims in the ooze, consuming it all. The magic within the giant shark bowl requires great energy to maintain, keeping the creature constantly hungry.

**_Unknown Origin_**. A paranoid lich concocted this creature as an "improvement" on other oozes built to guard phylacteries. The lich reasoned that the illusion of a reward hidden inside the transparent ooze might sway possible thieves away from its true phylactery, especially if such a treasure had a "guard."

**_Ooze Nature_**. The giant shark bowl doesn't require sleep.
