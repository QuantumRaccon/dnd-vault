The dwarven ringmage is a master of the imbuing magic of the reaver dwarves. With his aid, his reaver allies are more than just dangerous warriors; they can augment their abilities with powerful spells or surprise their enemies with unexpected powers. Often well armored and always bearing a host of spells, the dwarven ringmage can dominate any battlefield.
