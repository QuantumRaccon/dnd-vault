## Description
---
>A clumsy-looking flightless bird with a short, conical beak and no feathers or skin stares blankly with its single eye. Its organs are held in place by a slimy, transparent membrane.

**_Nearly Mindless_**. Orniraptors are creatures of pure instinct and share more in common with the basest vermin than with beasts. They attack anything that moves and peck off bits and pieces of their prey as they hunt, gobbling bites as it flees.

**_Troublesome Pests_**. Orniraptors tend to be more troublesome than dangerous, due to their persistence in striking at anything that moves. However, the creatures are capable of sharing their perceptions when near each other. This makes them particularly deadly when one notices something move and dozens of orniraptors suddenly converge on that point.

**_Quiet Yet Loud_**. Orniraptors have no vocal organs and simply squawk soundlessly as they go about their business. Their movements tend to be jerky and clumsy, though, and therefore quite audible.
