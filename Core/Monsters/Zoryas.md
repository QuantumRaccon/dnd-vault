## Description
---
_The beautiful, winged woman dressed in voluminous, yellow robes bears a morningstar in one hand and a large, elaborately-crafted, lantern in the other._

**_Brilliant Halos_**. Zoryas angels are the bringers and enders of light. Appearing at dawn, they ensure that the sun's rays penetrate dark places. At dusk, they hasten light's retreat, allowing darkness its portion. Zoryas angels are bathed in bright white and yellow light. Their brows are adorned with a shining halo consisting of small rotating orbs, leading many to sometimes mistake them for a sunrise when seeing them on the horizon.
**_Ushers and Key Holders_**. They are known to escort the avatars of gods onto and away from the mortal plane. The angels may open and close doors between the celestial plane and the mortal one. Doing so is taxing, and they must rest for several days afterwards. It is said that the brave and the foolish have stolen a zoryas' interplanar keys while the angel recuperated. These stories invariably end poorly for the thieves, who are immolated by the angered angel's wrath.
**_Immortal Nature_**. The zoryas angel doesn't require food, drink, or sleep.
