## Description
---
>An ear-piercing shriek echoes in the cavern. The sound comes from a human-sized mushroom whose stalk steadily swells with air as it shrieks.

**_Thunderous Shriek_**. Boomers are a subspecies of shrieker, nearly indistinguishable from their more innocuous cousins. When shrieking, however, the stalk of the boomer noticeably expands, swelling with air until it releases the air in a thunderous burst of noise. Like its more common relative, it is often deliberately cultivated by intelligent subterranean races as a defensive measure against intruders.
