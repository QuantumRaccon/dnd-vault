## Description
---
_The figure looks like any other knight in black plate armor until its ebon longsword strikes true, draining the life force of those it hits._

**_Born in Despair_**. A vampiric knight is created when a holy knight is brought low on the field of battle by a vampire. Rather than taking on the traits of a normal vampire, the knight turns into a unique creature, destined to serve its murderer for eternity.

**_Unaffected by Sunlight_**. The process of a vampiric knight's rebirth makes it immune to the effects of sunlight, unlike a normal vampire. This makes the knight a valued servant, capable of delivering messages—or death—at any moment.

**_Undead Nature_**. The vampiric knight doesn't require air.
