## Description
---
>A rectangular slab of thick, green ooze flows slowly across the floor. Twisting metallic veins and strange lights illuminate its translucent interior, and everything it touches dissolves into a formless sludge.

**_Artificial Oozes_**. Though fabricators superficially resemble monsters like [[ochre jelly \|ochre jellies]] or [[gelatinous cube \|gelatinous cubes]], they are in fact a type of construct composed of millions of minute constructs connected by an intelligent hive-mind. Most fabricators were built to aid in the construction of advanced machinery or structures and normally are not aggressive. However, their programming sometimes calls for the disposal of organic life, and they do not hesitate to apply fatal force when necessary.

**_Relic of Past Empires_**. The first fabricators were built by a cabal of ancient mages from a forgotten empire to construct a great weapon to use against their enemies. This weapon was completed and unleashed, subsequently dooming the creators and leaving the fabricators to carry on with the tasks assigned to them. Over time, the magical bonds to their masters' work slowly unraveled, freeing many fabricators from their responsibilities and leaving them without purpose. Today, some of these fabricators are employed by mage guilds to aid in the construction of magic items, communicating with the mages by etching words on sheets of copper.

**_Construct Nature_**. A fabricator doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
