## Description
---


A shadow mastiff alpha has the statistics of a normal shadow mastiff, with the following modifications:

- The alpha has above average (42â€“54) hit points.
- It has an Intelligence of 6 (-2).
- It has the Terrifying Howl action option described below.

**_Terrifying Howl_**. The shadow mastiff howls. Any beast or humanoid within 300 feet of the mastiff and able to hear its howl must succeed on a DC 11 Wisdom saving throw or be [[frightened]] for 1 minute. A [[frightened]] target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success. If a target's saving throw is successful or the effect ends for it, the target is immune to any shadow mastiff's Terrifying Howl for the next 24 hours.
