## Description
---


Some adult stone giants like to grab enemies and fling them through the air. They can also roll boulders across the ground, striking multiple enemies in a line. These abilities are represented by the following action options.

**_Fling_**. The giant tries to throw a Small or Medium creature within 10 feet of it. The target must succeed on a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw or be hurled up to 60 feet horizontally in a direction of the giant's choice and land [[prone]], taking 3 (**1d6**) bludgeoning damage for every 10 feet it was thrown.
**_Rolling Rock_**. The giant sends a rock tumbling along the ground in a 30-foot line that is 5 feet wide. Each creature in that line must make a DC 17 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**3d10 + 6**) bludgeoning damage and falling [[prone]] on a failed save
