## Description
---
_This stunted creature, wrapped almost entirely in the remnants of a cloak, has the face of an emaciated goblin. Its tiny hole of a mouth looks incapable of speech, and its glazed eyes stare at nothing._

**_Warped by the Unknowable_**. These creatures were once goblins, still retaining their general size and form, but long exposure to the psyche-obliterating presence of Great Old Ones has warped them in a variety of ways. They no longer speak aloud but communicate telepathically in images. Chaos-spawn goblins no longer eat as they once did, receiving all of their sustenance from the star-born creatures they now serve.


**_Single-minded Servants_**. Raiding and taking captives still occupies much of the chaos-spawn's time, but now their captives are placed inside organic pods or orifices of various kinds which grow in the ground below their masters' feet in web-like structures. There, the Great Old Ones drain whatever it is they wish from the captives, who leave nothing but a gel-like substance behind. This substance is what sustains the chaosspawn goblins, which they take in through feeding tubes.


**_Loyal Servants_**. In their hunts for captives, they do not hesitate to prey on goblins. For this reason, and out of sheer terror, other goblins avoid the chaos-spawn as much as they are able. Indeed, the areas chaos-spawn inhabit are often barren of other intelligent life.
