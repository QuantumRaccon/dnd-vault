## Description
---
_Sometimes called folding angels, algoriths are lawful beings made from sheer force, pure math, and universal physical laws._

**_Creatures of Pure Reason_**. They are the border guards of the Conceptual Realms, warding subjective beings from the Realms of the Absolute. Eternal, remorseless, and unceasingly vigilant, they guard against the monstrosities that lurk in the multiverse's most obscure dimensions, and seek out and eliminate chaos even from the abodes of the gods.

**_Foes of Chaos_**. They visit mortal realms when chaos threatens to unravel a location, or when the skeins of fate are tangled. On some occasions, an algorith will serve a god of Law or answer the summons of a skein witch.
Algoriths fight with conjured blades of force, and they can also summon universal energy that deconstructs randomness, weakening enemies or reducing them to finely ordered crystalline dust.

**_Social but Mysterious_**. In groups, they move and fight in silent coordination. Only tiny variations in the formulas etched into their skins identify one algorith from another. Five is a number of extreme importance to all algoriths, but few are willing (or able) to explain why to anyone who isn't an algorith. Algoriths may have castes, ranks, or commanders, but no mortal has decoded the mathematical blazons adorning their flesh. The algoriths themselves refuse to discuss these formulas with those who do not comprehend them.
