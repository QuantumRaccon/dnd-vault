## Description
---
_A massive giant reeking of rotting flesh shambles forward. Its rubbery skin constantly ripples as if living things are trapped underneath._

**_Weapon Against Giants_**. In the past, a necromancer kingdom neared destruction from rampaging giants. Their undead were not sufficient to defeat the giants, so they turned to even darker arts. The necromancers flayed the flesh off hill giants, keeping the skins mostly intact, and stuffed the resulting sacks of flesh full of humanoid bodies before sewing it back together. Then, they enveloped their creations in necrotic energy until the giant flesh animated. . . along with the zombies trapped inside.


**_Out of Many, One_**. A grave behemoth is more than the sum of its grisly parts. The dark ritual forms a hive mind between the behemoth and its zombie tenants, which act as an extension of the behemoth's will.


**_Undead Nature_**. A grave behemoth doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
