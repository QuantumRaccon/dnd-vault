## Description
---
>A gray-skinned human steps from the shadows. Dripping mandibles emerge from its too-wide mouth, and six lithe and long arms unfold from beneath its robes to grasp its prey in vicious claws.

**_Bridging the Veil_**. The somberweave is a spider-like fey creature that relies on the fragile threads separating the Material Plane from the Shadow Realm. Spanning the gap between the two planes, it weaves a web anchored in both worlds. It hides in the section of its web anchored in the Shadow Realm and waits for victims on the Material Plane. If plied with treasure or food, the somberweave can be convinced to offer travelers in one realm access to the other, but it is just as likely to capture and eat such travelers.

**_Tenebrous Skein_**. The web of the somberweave is made of pure darkness, the essence of the Shadow Realm. Clever travelers who defeat a somberweave can follow the remnants of its web to find passage into or out of the Shadow Realm. Shadow fey who travel frequently between the Shadow Realm and the Material Plane prize somberweave webs as the primary material for creating items that allow for easier travel between the planes.
