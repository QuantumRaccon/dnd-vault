## Description
---
_The bronze and mithral figure advances with heavy movements. Its eye lenses glare dark blue, and gears click when it swings its glaive._

An intricate construction of bronze, steel, copper, and mithral, the gearforged templar is an imposing sight. A humanoid spirit contained in a soulgem animates the heavy body of gears and springs. Gearforged are relatively rare, and the champion is a paragon among them.

**_Tireless Defender_**. The gearforged templar is relentless in pursuit of its duty. More so then  other gearforged, the champion's mindset becomes fixed on its charge to the exclusion of distractions and even magical coercion. Gearforged templars serve as commanders of military or guard units, bodyguards for important individuals, or personal champions for nobility.

**_Constructed Nature_**. The gearforged templar doesn't require food, drink, air, or sleep.
