## Description
---
>A tiny bird swoops through the air and alights on a nearby branch. It has the body of a tiny hawk, the colorful wings of a butterfly, and the head of an elf with large, luminous eyes.

**_Miniscule Fey_**. Dwelling in pastoral woods and rich farmland, the lymarien is one of the smallest fey in existence. Barely larger than a wasp, a lymarien is frequently mistaken for a butterfly and often ignored by larger creatures. They are sometimes preyed upon by birds like [[owl \|owls]] and [[crow \|crows]], or attacked by evil fey like [[morko \|morkos]] (Creature Codex).

**_Guardians of the Young_**. Lymariens have a fondness for fey and animal young, sometimes putting their lives at risk against superior opponents to save such creatures. When faced with a particularly powerful threat, lymariens form into massive, short-lived [[lymarien swarm \|swarms]], gaining potent magical abilities in the process.


> [!INFO] Lymarien Familiars
>Some lymarien might choose to serve a good-aligned spellcaster as a familiar. Such lymarien have the following trait.
**_Familiar_**. The lymarien can serve another creature as a familiar, forming a magic, telepathic bond with that willing companion. While the two are bonded, the companion can sense what the lymarien senses as long as they are within 1 mile of each other. While the lymarien is within 10 feet of its companion, the companion shares the lymarien's Speak with Beasts trait. At any time and for any reason, the lymarien can end its service as a familiar, ending the telepathic bond.
