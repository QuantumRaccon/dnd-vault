## Description
---
**_Dragon Skeleton Template_**. The corpse of any true dragon can be animated as a dragon skeleton. When a true dragon becomes a dragon skeleton, it retains its statistics except as described below. The dragon skeleton loses all traits that assume the dragon has a living body, such as Amphibious, or has particular knowledge, such as Spellcasting. The dragon might retain or lose any or all of its lair actions or inherit new ones, as the GM sees fit.
**_Type_**. The skeleton's type changes to undead, and it no longer requires air, food, drink, or sleep.

**_Alignment_**. The skeleton's alignment changes to lawful evil.

**_Ability Scores_**. The skeleton's Intelligence score is reduced to 8 (+-1), if it was higher, otherwise it retains its Intelligence score. Its Wisdom score changes to 10 (+0), and its Charisma score changes to 8 (+-1).

**_Skill Proficiencies_**. The skeleton loses all skill proficiencies.

**_Damage Vulnerabilities_**. The skeleton is vulnerable to bludgeoning damage.

**_Damage Immunities_**. The skeleton is immune to poison damage.

**_Condition Immunities_**. The skeleton is immune to exhaustion and to the poisoned condition.

**_Languages_**. The skeleton understands all languages it knew in life but can't speak.

**_New Action: Bite_**. If the skeleton deals any damage type in addition to piercing with its bite, it no longer deals that additional damage.

**_New Action: Breath Weapons_**. The skeleton's breath weapon is replaced by this new option, which recharges on a roll of a 5 or 6 on a **d6**. The skeleton can use one of the following breath weapons, which has the same save DC as the dragon's original breath weapon and affects an area based on the dragon skeleton's age category.
- **Shard Breath.**: The skeleton exhales a cone of bone shards, which deals the same amount of damage as the dragon skeleton's original breath weapon, but the damage type is piercing instead. Creatures in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a successful save, the creature takes half the damage.
- **Noxious Breath.**: The skeleton exhales a cone of gas. Each creature in the area must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. A creature [[poisoned]] in this way can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the [[poisoned]] condition on itself on a success.
