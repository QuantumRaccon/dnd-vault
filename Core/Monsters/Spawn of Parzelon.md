## Description
---
_A drape of long hair obscures the countenance of this shapely woman. As she turns, her sharp-toothed leonine visage is revealed. Suddenly, long needlelike claws protrude from her lithe fingertips, and her dark blue feline eyes narrow in hungry anticipation._

**_Daughters of the Dread Prophet_**. Born from accursed liaisons with mortal bloodlines, these amalgams of lioness and lady are the insidious progeny of the Arch-Devil Parzelon, King of Secrets. The fiendishly graceful spawn of Parzelon live only to serve their infernal father and his hideous whims.
