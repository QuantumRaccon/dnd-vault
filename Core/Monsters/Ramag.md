## Description
---
_These few denizens of a blasted desert waste now huddle in the remains of an ancient city—a city magically scattered across hundreds of miles._

**_Once Human_**. The ramag were a powerful tribe of dimensional sorcerers allied with a great society of titans, and they were indeed human in ages past. Over time, strange practices warped them into their current state, and they are clearly no longer purely human. Their limbs grow too long in proportion to their bodies, giving them a stooped, odd posture. Their features are angular, and a ramag's hair is impossibly thick; each strand is the width of a human finger. They wear their strange hair tied back in decorative clasps.

**_Portal Network_**. The ramag used their innate magical gifts to maintain powerful magical conduits, ley lines that crisscrossed the titan's empire. This mastery of arcane might allowed instantaneous travel to the farthest-flung outpost. The ramag still maintain a network of magical monoliths that connect the scattered districts of their home, but this network is frayed and fading.

**_Studious and Powerful_**. Although physically weak, the ramag are sharp-witted, studious, and naturally infused with magic. Lifetimes of exposure to the warping effect of their runaway magical energy have given the ramag innate control over magic, as well as sharp resistance to it. They are acutely aware of their responsibility for keeping magic in check, and fully know the danger of uncontrolled magical energies. Even the the lowliest ramag has a sharp intellect and a natural understanding of magic.
Many ramag take up the study of wizardry. Few become wandering adventurers, but well-equipped expeditions sometimes leave their homeland to inspect the surrounding countryside.

> [!INFO] Ramag in Midgard
>The ramag all live within the twelve scattered districts of their home city, Ramagani (home, in their dialect), with 11 districts in the Abandoned Lands of the Southlands and one on an island off the coast. Though the districts are far apart, the ramag consider them all part of one great metropolis. The inhabited districts are guarded by powerful ramag spellcasters and by the Stormwatch—a garrison of arcane warriors who operate enchanted lightning ballistae in defense of the city. (A lightning ballista functions identically to a standard ballista but does an additional 1d10 lightning damage with each hit.)
