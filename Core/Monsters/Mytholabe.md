## Description
---
_An ever-shifting clockwork wonder engineered by the divine floats a few feet off the ground, bearing the weapons of legends long past._

When heroes die, their magic equipment is often buried with them or passed to their descendents, but sometimes the gods have other plans for such items. The gods will bind the personal effects of their many fallen champions into clockwork mechanisms that do their bidding.

**_Impervious_**. Crafted from the finest, toughest materials, and resonating with divine power that emits a deep, beautiful thrum, it is virtually impossible to damage a mytholabe through conventional heroic means. Magic weapons clang harmoniously off it with no lasting impact, and magical effects fare only slightly better.

**_Weakness to the mundane_**. Mytholabes are broken, not killed. A common spear thrust into a gear will mar the perfection of its mechanical workings and its harmonic resonance. Mundane weapons are the most effective, but the nails-on-chalkboard screeching during the dismantling process must be painfully endured.

**_Housing for sentience_**. Sometimes a sentient weapon is part of the machine, and its personality takes over (or corrupts) it. Some weapons find this pleasing; others, suffocating.

**_Construct Nature_**. mytholabe doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
