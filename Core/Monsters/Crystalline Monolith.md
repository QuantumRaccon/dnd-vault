## Description
---
>The cavern glitters with refracted light bouncing off thousands of crystals. A towering menhir of shimmering crystal dominates the center of the cavern.

Whether a rare evolution of silicate life or a wandering nomadic race from some alternate reality, crystalline monoliths are enigmatic beings found deep underground in caverns where giant crystals flourish and grow.
**_Crystal Gardens_**. Crystalline monoliths reside in areas of living crystal, these formations often growing to gigantic proportions, resembling the monolith itself. Some sages speculate that crystalline monoliths grow crystals to certain specifications, then use their magic to instill sentience in the crystals as a means of reproducing. Whether the gardens are for reproduction or some other mysterious purpose, the crystal monoliths are very protective of them. The environment of these gardens is often not comfortable for most humanoid life; the temperature may be extremely hot or cold, or the cavern may contain poisonous gases or even be partially-submerged in water.

**_Magical Philosophers_**. Crystalline monoliths prefer to spend their days in quiet contemplation. They tend their crystal gardens and meditate. If encountered by other intelligent creatures, they are generally open to exchanges of information and intellectual discussion. They prefer to communicate telepathically but can create sounds through vibrations that mimic speech. Aggressive intruders are dealt with according to the level of threat they exhibit. If the crystalline monolith considers the intruders unlikely to cause it harm, it will often use its magic to misdirect opponents or lure them away from the garden. Should the intruders persist or show themselves to be dangerous, a crystalline monolith is not above using its magic to crush and destroy them. It is especially unforgiving to those that try to steal or damage crystals in its lair.

**_Crystalline Nature_**. A crystalline monolith doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.


**_A Crystalline Monolith's Lair_**. Crystalline monoliths lair in vast gardens of crystal in mountains or deep underground, often near areas of extreme temperature or geothermal activity. They harness the ambient magical energy in the crystals to defend themselves and repel intruders.
