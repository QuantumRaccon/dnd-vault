## Description
---
_A skeletal cadaver bedecked in the motley attire of a fool capers about while making jokes that mock mortality._

**_Amusing Death_**. When a jester on his deathbed moves an evil god of death to laughter, the fool sometimes gains a reprieve. He or she becomes a grim jester, whose pranks and merriment serve to entertain the god of death. Their purpose is to bring an end to mortal lives in a gruesome, comic, and absurd manner. As long as such jesters keep the death god amused, their continued unlife is assured.

**_Grisly Humor_**. A grim jester's killing jokes are not necessarily funny to their victims, but they offer a grim finality in combat. A killing joke might be absurd, such as "Here is your final pineapple soul, a parting gift, goodbye" or meta-game related, such as "I remember the days when a [[finger of death]] killed people" or sheer braggadocio such as "Your footwork is atrocious, and your spell's lost its focus, your party's no match for my hocuspocus." Others might be high-flown, such as "Mortal, your time has come, the bell within your skull does ring, ding, dong, dead." Grim jesters are famous for grim, bitter mockery such as "Your blood on fire, your heart pumps its last, show me now a hero's last gasp (that's the one! Goodbye!)" or "Odin's raven has come for you; the Valkyries were busy. You lose, mortal."
Rarely does a grim jester's mockery entertain the livingâ€”but gods of death, chained angels, and most demons find them quite amusing.

**_Randomness_**. Grim jesters often get their hands on wands of wonder and scrolls of chaos magic. Beware the grim jester with a [[deck of many things]]2014they are quite talented in pulling cards whose magic then applies to foes and spectators.
