## Description
---
_Twinkling motes of light move around this draconic creature's body like stars, their reflections twinkling across its metallic scales._

**_Returned Travelers_**. A drake's curiosity sometimes drives it to seek experiences beyond its plane, and it finds companions with which it travels the multiverse. Such drakes return quite clearly changed in appearance, demeanor, and ability. Regardless of which type of drake embarked on the journey, the creature always returns as a star drake.

**_Mortal Protectors_**. Star drakes consider themselves protectors of the Material Plane. They view those from other planes as meddlers in the affairs of humanoid races, regarding fiends and celestials as equally threatening. Star drakes might negotiate with, drive off, or destroy such meddlers. Occasionally, they lead extraplanar incursions to make it clear outsiders are unwelcome.

**_Glimmering Lights_**. A star drake differs in appearance from dragons primarily by its mottled metallic scales and the nimbus of tiny stars surrounding its body. A star drake measures 10 feet long and weighs roughly 500 lb.
