**_Engines of Decimation_**. The harbinger of wrath is a construct of immense size and destructive potential. Just seeing a harbinger causes most creatures to flee in terror, and few are willing or able to face one in battle. Creatures allied with a harbinger must also fear its terrible wrath, as it is not against skewering its allies on its many spikes to rejuvenate itself in the heat of battle.

**_Forged by Demons_**. The first harbingers were created in vast demonic forges by a powerful demon prince to use against his enemies. Since then, the construction process has passed to other demon princes and evil gods that delight in devastation and mayhem.

**_Construct Nature_**. A harbinger doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
