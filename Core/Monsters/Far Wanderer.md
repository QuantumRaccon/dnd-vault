## Description
---
_An aberrant traveler and trader, the flesh of these elf-like humanoids glows in a shifting pattern of luminous constellations._

**_Cosmic Origins_**. The Court of Countless Stars dwells beyond the light of known suns on a demi-plane between cold and distant constellations. There, these otherworldly creatures worship Yorama the Living Star, an ancient aberration with the power to create life. The Court seeks to extend its influence across the planes of the universe, taking particular interest in fey creatures. Each far wanderer is connected to Yorama, who grants it magic and long life.


**_Powers of the Mind_**. The far wanderers possess innate psychic powers, which they can manifest into harming or healing energy. They are highly intelligent, curious, and manipulative. They often ally with fey or sylvan courts, then use their position to create conflict with other beings, taking notes on the nature of disharmony.


**_Yoramian Infusion_**. A far wanderer doesn't require air, food, drink, or sleep.
