## Description
---
>Muck covers this muscular snake, which seems more at home in the silt and water on the ground than among tree boughs.

**_Earth Elemental Ancestry_**. Formerly native to the Plane of Earth, quickserpents migrated to the Material Plane centuries ago because of a catastrophe that destroyed the area of the plane where they laired. The catastrophe also shunted the surviving serpents to swamps with connections to the Plane of Earth. The creatures adapted to their new environments and lost many of their elemental traits. They still understand the language of earth elementals and typically avoid attacking the elementals. A handful of powerful elementals that remember the snakes have attempted to reintegrate them to the Plane of Earth with mixed results.

**_Ambusher from Below_**. A quickserpent, like many terrestrial [[constrictor snake \|constrictor snakes]], ambushes its prey. However, it waits below the surface where it picks up the vibrations of creatures traveling above it. If the terrain is suitable, the serpent churns the ground into quicksand to pull unsuspecting prey into the earth. While its victim struggles to escape the mire, the serpent takes advantage of its prey's helplessness to wrap itself around and crush its prey. If the serpent manages to ensnare more than one creature, it targets the one with the most success emerging from the quicksand.

**_The Queen of Serpents' Recent Find_**. As quickserpents lost much of their elemental nature and become terrestrial creatures, the [[Queen of Serpents]] (Creature Codex) became more aware of their existence. The serpents have slowly accepted her as their sovereign, and they now rarely heed commands from [[earth elemental \|earth elementals]]. The quickserpents at her command fight degenerate serpentfolk infesting the swamps.
