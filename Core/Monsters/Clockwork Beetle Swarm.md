## Description
---
_Light glints off the moving parts of almost a thousand clockwork beetles in a biting cloud._

**_Freed But Foolish_**. Clockwork beetle swarms form when several of the creatures break free of their creators and bond together in a noisy mass of clattering mechanical parts. Severed from the bond of their creators, the beetle swarm lacks the telepathy of singular clockwork beetles and has a reduced mental capacity.
