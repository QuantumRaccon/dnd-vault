As a dhampir reaches pubescence its aversion to sunlight and unnatural talents betray its vampiric heritage if it wasn't already aware. By the time it reaches maturity, most dhampirs have made a decision to openly embrace, or completely reject, any connection to vampires or vampirism.

						"Despite myths to the contrary, dhampirs must eat, breathe, and sleep as all flesh and blood creatures do. Though dhampirs are intrinsically enhanced by necromantic magics, they are still living beings. Most, but not all, dhampirs are sterile and cannot sire or bear children of their own. Those rare dhampirs who can produce children rarely pass down their vampiric influence to the next generation.

Whether their parent reveals the truth to the child, or the dhampir deduces its parentage on its own, most dhampirs are well aware of their true nature by the time they reach adulthood.",
						"Awareness of a blood relation to an immortal creature can cause a fascination with mortality in dhampirs. This can cause some dhampirs to pursue means of immortality, most often becoming vampires, while others seek to make peace with and accept their mortality, turning to religion or spiritual studies. Although they have no need to consume blood, many dhampirs experience unbidden violent thoughts and dark appetites. Every dhampir chooses for themselves whether to indulge in these impulses or spend a lifetime exercising restraint and self-discipline."

Seeking power, this house incorporated into their ranks fiends and demons, interbreeding with them to give life to a new, more powerful elven bloodline. Thus, the fey'ri were born - devilish in their nature and strength, and yet - as intelligent and swift as their elven parents. When this treachery was discovered, the House was renamed Daemonfey and deemed enemies to all elven kingdoms. A war followed. The Daemonfey armies, although empowered by lesser demons and fey'ri, were defeated. Most of them were killed in the conflict, sealed in prisons - only some have escaped.",

Some elves shunned or even killed such children (even with their parents), being afraid of what could become of them. Others raised them as their own, teaching them the way of the elves. And some newly born were kidnapped by those surviving after the war fey'ri, so that they would be raised in hate to the elven kind.

The treachery was discovered and the House members were either killed, imprisoned or scattered.",
						"Nevertheless, the spawn of this interbreeding process are the fey'ri. They mostly resemble elves in their features, yet they have something in them, resembling there devilish bloodline - barbed tails, fangs, forked tongues, horns or any combination of them. Some even had multiple sets of limbs or even bat-like wings. Though they are born with the ability to hide their fiendish looks and resemble a normal elf."

Of course, this made them prideful, looking negatively on outsiders and even other elves. Though they had respect towards intelligence, strength and flexible morals. Today, this fey'ri are either in hiding or prison, having a grudge on the remaining elven Houses and are planning to overthrow those, who they deem traitors; or, maybe, escaping the claws of death, some of them reestablished their values and are now on a quest for redemption?",
						"There are other fey'ri, though - the younger ones, that were born after the Seven Citadels' War. Because even once tainted by the fiendish blood, there's always a chance to give birth to a fey'ri. Some elven societies, being afraid of the cursed bloodline, shun and even kill these children. Others raise them as normal children, never even mentioning that they are \"different\". Being quite nimble from childhood and talented in magics, fey'ri often became Warriors, Rogues or practitioners of the Bladesong. These fey'ri, though still concealing their true form outside of their homeland, tend to value life the same way as their elven brethren, even though they are still trying to experience life to its fullest, because of the chaotic nature that their blood has in it."

						"It is rare for a spidara to settle in one place for too long, though visiting towns and cities and even short stays in them are not uncommon. Spidarans are not a nomadic people because of a disdain for civilisation, but because of a culturally deep interest in the world and the people who reside within in.",
						"They move around to feed this interest that stems from a point from their early history before they were nomads. Once they were scholars who lived in library filled citadels, who went out into the world only to gather more information for their studies, but eventually they decided that the gathering information was better than collecting and slowly they stopped ever returning to the citadels.",
						"It is dangerous to walk the wilderness of the Lost Continent alone, so spidarans like most other nomads almost always travel in groups, though spidarans groups change quite frequently. Family groups often stick together while children mature, but once they reach adulthood they may join another nomadic group at any time, even joining groups made up mostly or entirely of people of other races. Though this is all more accurate for the most common of the spidarans the aratho than for their subterranean cousins the menari.",
						"Spidarans can be found almost everywhere in the Lost Continent, though they are seen much less commonly in the vast desert and further north. No matter where they go, it is not especially hard for them to find something to do, work is always needed, they can create and weave web ropes which can be used for a variety of purposes, and knowledge of the world is often useful. For a nomadic people turning to a life of adventuring is not an uncommon, especially when they are a people who may move between different groups frequently."

Instead they prefer to use the names of their subraces to define themselves, aratho for the majority and menari for those who are from the under passages.",
						"Most spidarans in the Lost Continent are aratho, they are what most people who live there will think of when they imagine spidarans. Their upper bodies are more likely to be completely or mostly human-like, and they all have an innate interest in the world or in people whether that interest is just learning or trying to fully understand depends on the individual.",
						"Menari on the other hand deal with other races a lot less often, and to survive in the dangerous underground tunnels of the under passages they developed a lot more spider-like features. They are still nomadic and can develop strong interests for certain things, but their main priority is survival, so that comes first for them."

The race they feel a connection to, can have reasons as simple as just a race that they have travelled with or one that they have friends from, or it could be a much deeper connection.",
						"The menari spidarans who inhabit the under passage typically have a smaller pool of names to choose from as they meet less people from other races. This means that certain names may get repeated a lot, or even be passed down through a family repeatedly. Those names also often change slightly over time, changing to fit the arachnos language better is quite common but they can also change in other ways."
