You've manifested the fiery combat emblematic of fire giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Born of Flame**: You have resistance to fire damage.
- **Searing Ignition**: When you take the [[Attack]] action on your turn, you can replace one of your attacks with a magical burst of flame. Each creature of your choice within 15 feet of you that can see you must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equals 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Constitution modifier). On a failed save, a creature takes fire damage equal to **2d6** + your proficiency bonus and is [[blinded]] until the start of your next turn; on a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage with no additional effects. You can use your Searing Ignition a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
