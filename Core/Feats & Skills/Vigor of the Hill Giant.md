You've manifested the resilience emblematic of hill giants, granting you the following benefits:

- **Bulwark**: When you are subjected to an effect that would move you at least 5 feet or knock you [[prone]], you can use your reaction to steady yourself. You are then neither moved nor knocked [[prone]].
- **Hearty Health**: When you are subjected to a spell that restores your hit points, you can regain additional hit points equal to your Constitution modifier. You can regain these additional hit points a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.
