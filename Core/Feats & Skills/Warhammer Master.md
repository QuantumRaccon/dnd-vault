_This feat is presented as an illustrative example of a poorly-designed feat, and is not intended to be used in play. The [[Fell Handed]] feat is presented as a well-designed implementation of the same ideas, and should be used instead._

When you hit a creature with a [[warhammer]], the  creature must succeed on a Strength saving  throw (DC 8 + your proficiency bonus + your  Strength modifier) or be knocked [[prone]].

In addition, you can use your warhammer to  knock away a foe's shield. If you hit a creature  that's using a shield, you can have the attack deal  no damage and force the creature to drop its  shield.
