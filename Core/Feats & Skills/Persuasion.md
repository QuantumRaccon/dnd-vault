When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the DM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.

The DM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:

-   Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip
-   Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation
