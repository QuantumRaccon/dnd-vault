Void Speech is the language of creatures of the Outer Darkness in the Midgard Campaign Setting, spoken by vile things that are malevolent towards humans and their allies, and that seek to bring about ruinous apocalypse of dark gods. Substitute any ancient language with an evil reputation if you are using another setting.
