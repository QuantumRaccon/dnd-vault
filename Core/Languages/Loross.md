Loross, a language spoken by the Netherese, is a dead tongue. Very few creatures in the world today would recognize it, much less speak it. Loross used the Draconic alphabet in its written form, while the spoken language had many similarities with Elvish, due to the cultural influence the elves had on Netherese civilization. A character who speaks Elvish can understand what a creature speaking Loross is saying, and vice versa. A character who has the Cloistered Scholar or Sage background, or a warlock who knows the Eyes of the Rune Keeper invocation, can translate written Loross without an ability check.
