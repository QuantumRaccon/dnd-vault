A creature cursed with a minor surface curse feels pain when exposed to natural light. While cursed and in sunlight or moonlight, the creature has disadvantage on attack rolls and on Wisdom (Perception) checks. The curse ends if the affected creature completes a long rest in darkness. Alternatively, the curse can be lifted early by a [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.
