Until the disease is cured, the infected creature's skin slowly becomes more ooze-like, and its hp maximum decreases by 5 (**2d4**) for every 24 hours that elapse. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0. A humanoid slain by this disease rises 24 hours later as an [[Ochre Jelly]].
