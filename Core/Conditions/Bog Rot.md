Until the disease is cured, the infected creature's skin breaks out in a rot-like rash that slowly spreads across its body, and its hp maximum decreases by 7 (**2d6**) for every 24 hours that elapse. After the first 24 hours, the creature's skin starts to smell like rot, and creatures have advantage on Wisdom (Perception) and Wisdom (Survival) checks to find the infected creature. The reduction and rot smell last until the disease is cured. The creature dies if the disease reduces its hp maximum to 0.
