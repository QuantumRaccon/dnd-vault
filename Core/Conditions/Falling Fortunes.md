A creature cursed with falling fortunes is plagued with bad luck for 24 hours. While cursed, the creature can't add its proficiency bonus to any attack rolls or ability checks. If the cursed creature rolls a 20 on an attack roll or an ability check, the curse ends. Alternatively, the curse can be lifted early by a [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.
