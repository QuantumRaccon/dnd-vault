This disease affects humanoids who breathe. The eyes of infected creatures become glassy, and purple bruising appears on their spines, bulging as the disease progresses. At the end of each long rest after infection, an infected creature is wracked by terrible dreams or visions and must succeed a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or suffer one level of [[exhaustion]] that can't be removed until the disease is cured. After the creature has two levels of [[exhaustion]], it moves to the second stage of the infection. During the first stage of infection, a [[lesser restoration]] spell or similar magic ends the infection.

At the end of each long rest after the creature reaches the second stage of infection, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or become a thrall of the ophio fungus, falling completely under its control. A victim in the second stage of the infection or that is completely under the fungus' control can be restored only by killing the fungus that caused the infection or through the use of a [[wish]] spell.
