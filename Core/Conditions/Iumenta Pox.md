It takes **1d4** days for iumenta pox's symptoms to appear in an infected humanoid. A creature with iumenta pox has trouble breathing, and its skin erupts with painful green boils that ooze pus. As the disease progresses, these pustules turn black.

At the end of each long rest, an infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) necrotic damage. The creature's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the disease is cured. The target dies if this effect reduces its hp maximum to 0. When an infected creature dies, its corpse rises as a mold zombie **1d4** hours after death. Iumenta pox can be cured with two successful saving throws.
