At the end of each long rest, the infected creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw each day or take 9 (**2d8**) cold damage and 5 (**2d4**) necrotic damage and suffer one level of [[exhaustion]] if the creature has no levels of [[exhaustion]]. The target's hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the necrotic damage taken. The [[exhaustion]] and hp maximum reduction last until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's hp maximum to 0, the creature dies, and it rises as a winterghast **1d4** hours later. A creature that succeeds on two saving throws against the diseases recovers from it. Alternatively, the disease can be removed by the [[lesser restoration]] spell or similar magic.
