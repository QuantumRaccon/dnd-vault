Within a day, a dark discoloration around the wound is accompanied by the smell of putrefying flesh. Unless serious measures are taken to mask the smell, carrion eaters of all kinds will be drawn to the infected creature, gaining advantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks to track the creature by smell within their usual range.

While infected with carrion curse, a creature can't be healed magically and can only heal naturally through rest and by spending hit dice. At the end of each long rest, a creature infected with carrion curse must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [[exhaustion]]. If an infected creature succeeds on the saving throw, it no longer gains [[exhaustion]] levels each day. A second successful save at the end of a long rest cures the disease. The abyssal disease resists many efforts at treatment and can only be cured by a [[greater restoration]] spell or similar magic.

A living creature that dies from the effects of carrion curse has a 75 percent chance of rising again as a [[Blood Zombie]] within 24 hours.
