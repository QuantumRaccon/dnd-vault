At the end of each long rest, the diseased creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or its Dexterity score is reduced by **1d4**. The reduction lasts until the target finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. If the disease reduces the creature's Dexterity to 0, the creature dies and its body becomes a [[Suppurating Ooze]] **1d4** hours later. The disease lasts until removed by the [[lesser restoration]] spell or other similar magic.
