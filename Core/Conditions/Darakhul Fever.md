Spread mainly through bite wounds, this disease makes itself known within 24 hours by swiftly debilitating the infected. An infected creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw after every long rest. On a failed save, the victim takes 14 (**4d6**) necrotic damage, and its hp maximum is reduced by an amount equal to the damage taken. This reduction lasts until the victim finishes a long rest after the disease is cured. The victim recovers from the disease by making two consecutive successful saving throws. [[Greater restoration]] cures the disease, while [[lesser restoration]] gives the victim advantage on the next saving throw.

Primarily spread among humanoids, the disease can affect [[Ogre \|ogres]], and therefore other giants may be susceptible. If a creature dies while infected with darakhul fever, roll a **d20**, add the character's Constitution modifier, and find the result on the table below to determine what undead form the victim's body rises in.

|Roll|Result|
|---|-----------|
|1–9|None; victim is simply dead|
|10–16|[[Ghoul]]|
|17–20|[[Ghast]]|
|21+|Darakhul|
