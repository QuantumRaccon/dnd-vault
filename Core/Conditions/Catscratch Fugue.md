Catscratch fugue is a bacterial infection that only affects felids and feline humanoids. This infectious organism is carried by debris falling into the Material Plane from the Void and is transmitted either through contact with the crash site or by being bitten by a carrier.

Upon contact, the target must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become infected. Once the host is infected, catscratch fugue incubates inside it for 3 days. During this window, the victim's skin itches, and they are prone to violent mood swings. At the end of each long rest, the infected creature can repeat the saving throw, recovering from the disease on a success. A [[lesser restoration]] spell cast during the incubation time cures the disease.

After the third day, if the infection is still present, any negative emotion causes the victim to transform into a monstrous [[Catscratch]] intent on destroying everything around it. Only a [[wish]] spell can cure a [[Catscratch]] once it has transformed.
