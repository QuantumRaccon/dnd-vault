If the party is defeated, stabilized characters awaken after **1d4** hours to find themselves cocooned in sticky webs and suspended 10 feet off the floor, with spider eggs implanted in their bodies. A cocooned character is [[restrained]] and can use its action to try to escape by making a successful DC 15 Strength check.

Spider eggs implanted in a host hatch in **2d12** hours, killing the host as the baby spiders chew their way out. This infestation functions like a disease. A [[lesser restoration]] spell or similar magic cast upon the host kills the spider eggs, ending the threat.
