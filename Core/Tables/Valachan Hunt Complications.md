### Valachan Hunt Complications
---
|d20|Complication|
|----|------------|
|1|Chakuna appears and attacks. Roll a die. If you roll an even number, this occurs during another complication and you can roll again on this table. If you roll an odd number, Chakuna attacks suddenly without another complication.|
|2|Dense foliage, swampy ground, clouds of insects, or thick fog slows the party's travel to a crawl. The party chooses one character, who must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check or the party's travel speed is reduced by half for the next hour (this is in addition to any speed reduction from [[difficult terrain]]).|
|3|The area is riddled with traps set by Chakuna. A random character must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check or fall into a [[pits]] (see the ).|
|4|[[Chuul]], [[Vine Blight]], or [[Zombie Plague Spreader \|zombie plague spreaders]] (see ) ambush the party.|
|5|The characters find a tree bound in rope. One or more withered, oversized hearts hang from cords attached to its branches. Roll a die. If you roll an even number, the hearts look grim but are harmless. If you roll an odd number, the **1d6** hearts have the statistics of gnashing [[Death's Head \|death's heads]] (see ) and attack.|
|6|Clouds of insects, persistent leeches, or other parasites torment the party. Each character must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check or gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. Creatures immune to disease suffer no ill effects from the parasites.|
|7|The party encounters a [[druid]], [[green hag]], or [[displacer beast]] that is not part of the hunt. If a character succeeds on a DC 16 Charisma ([[Persuasion]]) check, that creature shows them a route that allows them to move at double their speed for the next hour and avoid rolling on this table at the end of that time.|
|8|An individual or a group of competitors—[[Gladiator]], [[Scout]], or [[Tribal Warrior]]—attempts to ambush the party.|
|9|Whispers in the Druidic language issue from the boughs of trees and cracks in the earth. They repeat one word: Blood.|
|10|A desperate competitor appears. Roll a die. If you roll an even number, the competitor is gravely wounded, incoherent, and suffering from hallucinations. If you roll an odd number, the competitor offers to help the party break the trial's rules and is struck dead by an arrow from the forest seconds later.|
|11|Dinosaurs, [[Giant Poisonous Snake]], or [[Hydra]] attack the party.|
|12|A rope bridge provides the only method of crossing a river or ravine. Each character must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check to cross the bridge or fall 60 feet into the jungle or water below. The bridge has AC 11, 16 hit points, and immunity to poison and psychic damage.|
|13|The party discovers an overgrown ruin. A character who succeeds on a DC 18 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check spots a relief carving of a wicked-looking figure ripping out its own heart.|
|14|A random character must succeed on a DC 14 Wisdom ([[Perception]]) check or fall into  (see the ).|
|15|[[Panther]], [[Displacer Beast]], or werepanthers ([[Weretiger]]) attempt to ambush the party.|
|16|The characters discover the corpse of a competitor. Roll a die. If you roll an even number, the corpse has a [[potion of healing]]. If you roll an odd number, the corpse's heart has been removed.|
|17|The party chooses one character who must succeed on a DC 16 Wisdom ([[Survival]]) check. On a failed check, the party becomes lost. It takes the characters 1 hour to realize they are **1d4** miles away from their assumed location in a disadvantageous direction.|
|18–20|No complication|
