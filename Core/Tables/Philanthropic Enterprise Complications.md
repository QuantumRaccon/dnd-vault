### Philanthropic Enterprise Complications
---
|d6|Complication|
|----|------------|
|1|The selected cause is secretly the purview of a thieves' guild or other criminal organization. The organization resents the franchise's efforts and decides to undermine the characters' future endeavors.* |
|2|A local reporter or official becomes convinced that the franchise's efforts are all about the characters' personal gain. The individual begins to monitor the franchise, and reports on any missteps.* |
|3|A group of individuals objects to the franchise's efforts, believing that the problem underlying the selected cause is part of the natural order. The group actively tries to convince others of the terrible side effects (real or otherwise) of the franchise's philanthropy.* |
|4|Another philanthropic group is already involved in the franchise's cause. That group tries to cast the franchise's efforts as ineffective and insincere.* |
|5|Hearing of the franchise's good works, people who are affected by some other issue requiring philanthropic assistance show up at franchise headquarters in huge numbers.|
|6|Members of the franchise work with an established group to perform the philanthropic enterprise. But it soon becomes clear that the group is a shamâ€”and that local officials are looking into their activities. The characters need to fix the situation, or risk being implicated in scandal by association.* |
