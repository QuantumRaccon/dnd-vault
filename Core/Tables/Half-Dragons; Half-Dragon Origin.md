### Half-Dragon Origin
---
|d6|Origin|
|----|------------|
|1|. The magical influence of a dragon's lair causes half-dragons to spontaneously arise among the area's other creatures.|
|2|. A dragon can cause a particular tree to produce magical fruit. When eaten by a creature able to bear children, the fruit causes the creature to bear a half-dragon.|
|3|. Love occasionally blossoms between dragons and creatures of other kinds, and this life bond can result in half-dragon children. Most half-dragons born of love are created as a magical gift.|
|4|. A creature that bathes in or drinks the blood of a dragon can sometimes be transformed into a half-dragon. A dragon might voluntarily offer some blood to bring this about, or it could happen accidentally when a would-be dragonslayer is splashed with dragon blood.|
|5|. A dragon might bestow the gift of draconic power on a newborn baby or an unborn child—as either a blessing or a curse.|
|6|. The hoard of an older dragon is imbued with that dragon's power. Those who steal from such a hoard might transform into half-dragons as that power leaches into them.|
