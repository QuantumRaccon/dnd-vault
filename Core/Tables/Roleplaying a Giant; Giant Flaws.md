### Giant Flaws
---
|d6|Flaw|
|----|------------|
|1|The ordning is too restrictive for the likes of me.|
|2|The lesser creatures of the world have no souls|
|3|Unity among giants is a myth, anyone not of my clan is a fair target for my weapons.|
|4|I care nothing for what others expect, to the point where I cannot help but contradict what others ask of me.|
|5|I am terrified of arcane magic and can be cowed by overt displays of it.|
|6|Ancient dragons fill me with dread. My knees grow weak in their presence.|
