### Demon Ideals
---
|d6|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Self-Preservation. It's everything and everyone for themselves in this cruel world.|
|2|Might. The world is divided into the strong who rule and the weak who obey or die.|
|3|Cunning. Always have a backup plan ready, especially if it involves betraying someone.|
|4|Strength. Strength is the one coin accepted in all realms and by all folk.|
|5|Ambition. We reach the station in the cosmos that we deserve due to our drive and talents.|
|6|Cruelty. Strength without regular demonstrations of its potential is an empty weapon.|
