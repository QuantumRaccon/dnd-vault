### Yuan-ti Flaws
---
|d6|Flaw|
|----|------------|
|1|I feel twinges of emotion, and it shames me that I am imperfect in this way.|
|2|I put too much credence in the dictates of a particular god.|
|3|I frequently overindulge in food and wine, and I am impaired and lethargic for days afterward.|
|4|I worship a forbidden god.|
|5|I secretly believe things would be better if I was in charge.|
|6|If I could get away with it, I would gladly kill and eat a superior yuan-ti.|
