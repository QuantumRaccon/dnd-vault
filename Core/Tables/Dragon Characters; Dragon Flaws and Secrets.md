### Dragon Flaws and Secrets
---
|d10|Flaw or Secret|
|----|------------|
|1|I find adventurers fearsome, and I'm convinced that I'll meet my doom at their hands one day.|
|2|One item in my possession is worth as much as the rest of my hoard combined, and the fear that it might be stolen consumes me.|
|3|Given the opportunity, I eat to excess and then fall into a long, deep sleep.|
|4|I would rather let my fearsome reputation scare away intruders than fight them off.|
|5|Other dragons would scorn me if they knew how fondly I regard my minions. They're so cute!|
|6|I am terrified of creatures from the Outer Planesâ€”especially modrons.|
|7|Another dragon has sworn to find and destroy me.|
|8|Humanoids are not ready to learn the horrible cosmic truths in the books in my hoard.|
|9|The prospect of living for centuries more exhausts me.|
|10|I'm convinced that a version of me on a different world in the Material Plane is hoping to destroy me and steal my hoard.|
