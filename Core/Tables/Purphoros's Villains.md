|1|A [[cult fanatic]] of Purphoros turns to Mogis to enhance his craft, engaging in bloody rituals to produce exquisite cursed weapons.|
|2|An aging [[veteran]] seeks to replace her body with living bronze and enlists a genius [[archmage]] of Purphoros to aid her. Then several of their test limbs escape.|
|3|A rebel ([[spy]]) plots to set fire to a temple of Heliod and dedicate the blaze to Purphoros, driving the gods toward a conflict he's certain Purphoros will win.|
|4|A [[gladiator]] of Purphoros partakes of the fumes at Mount Velus then goes on what seems to be a rampage that contributes to a mysterious design.|
|5|A [[priest]] of Purphoros condemns the party for treating their weapons and tools poorly, insisting they discard them until the heroes prove their worthiness.|
|6|A group of [[Oread \|oreads]] (see ) seeks inspiration in flames. The oreads leave Purphoros's forge and conduct thorough studies of everything they burn.|
