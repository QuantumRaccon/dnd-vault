|----|------------|
|1|The Oselo joyously adopt a new member into their community, but the ceremony erupts in strife when Chakuna appears and demands that all newcomers participate in the Trial of Hearts.|
|2|Shuaran warriors seek help in slaying a massive [[saber-toothed tiger]] killing their people. They don't mention that they recently lost the Cat of Felkovic, a sentient magic item similar to a [[figurine of wondrous power]] that conjures a feline killer.|
|3|A sapient [[giant spider]] emerges from the caverns known as the Council of the Whip Spider. It demands that the Oselo provide it a sacrifice, or every arachnid in Valachan will attack the village.|
|4|The [[tyrannosaurus rex]] called Mother Heartless rampages from the Forest of Fossils, incensed by something amiss in her hunting grounds.|
|5|The [[lizardfolk]] of the lakes surrounding the Anquara Plateau discover a submerged ruin and unleash an [[aboleth]] that now holds them in thrall.|
|6|Beast-shaped [[Treant]] animate and lay siege to Pantara Lodge, obeying Urik von Kharkov's will.|
|7|The merchant ship Zodiac runs aground on Kiru Island. The sailors seek help salvaging other shipwrecks and escaping back to seaâ€”preferably before Chakuna notices them.|
|8|A pack of [[Displacer Beast]] washes up dead in Sangui Cove. An enraged Chakuna prowls the jungle, slaying anyone she suspects of being involved.|
