### Topaz Dragon Ideals
---
|d6|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Solitude. My own company obviates the need for others in my life, whether they are dragons or lesser creatures. (Any)|
|2|Change. Consistency is stagnation. (Chaotic)|
|3|Mental Superiority. I hone my mental powers so I can confuse, control, or kill any who annoy me. (Evil)|
|4|Territoriality. Any creature that comes into my territory has forfeited its right to be upset by anything I do to it. (Evil)|
|5|Wonder. Though I don't wish to spend time in it, my soul sings at the sight of the vast beauty of the ocean. (Good)|
|6|Code of Combat. I despise most other dragons, but I meet them face to face without resorting to the base trickery I use on lesser creatures. (Lawful)|
