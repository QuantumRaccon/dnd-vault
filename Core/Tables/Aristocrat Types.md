|1|. Convinced that power and prestige lie just around the corner, this minor lordling grasps for every opportunity to climb the ranks.|
|2|. Reputation, wealth, and power are one and the same for the head of a family with world-spanning business holdings.|
|3|. Nothing is more appealing to this princeling than treasure. Their sprawling merchant caravan trails behind their palanquin as far as the eye can see.|
|4|. The leader of a noble family has turned against their nation, secretly opposing their liege for personal gain or ethical reasons.|
|5|. The sole heir of a vast fortune, this entrepreneur seeks allies to expand their wealth in a new business on the international, global, or planar stage.|
|6|. This young noble is destined to rule, but currently their whims are fickle and dangerous.|
