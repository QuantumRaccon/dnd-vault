### Deep Dragon Personality Traits
---
|d8|Trait|
|----|------------|
|1|I will not risk injury at the hands of weaker creatures—especially while I can turn them against one another and have them fight in my stead.|
|2|It is difficult for anyone not of dragonkind to penetrate the twisting labyrinth of my thoughts.|
|3|I might disagree with other dragons, but we are superior beings and should not lower ourselves to direct conflict.|
|4|I have no interest in going to the surface world. It's where one sends one's servants.|
|5|While the petty squabbles of other creatures bore and irritate me, I might hear out those who demonstrate an appreciation for the finer things in life by bringing me delicacies like clams or [[aboleth]] flesh.|
|6|I might be willing to exert myself to take out a [[mind flayer]]. Those disgusting creatures must be stopped.|
|7|I dream of seeing the deepest places in the ocean.|
|8|I find I rather enjoy the company of people—as long as they remain unaware of my true nature.|
