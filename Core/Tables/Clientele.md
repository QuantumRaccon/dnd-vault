|----|------------|
|1|. Your discretion and low-key approach to cases make you the perfect team to handle cases best keep out of the public eye.|
|2|. Whether deserved or not, you have a reputation for doing the right thing even if it comes without a reasonable fee. Anyone pitted against the rich and powerful knows to come to you for justice.|
|3|. Maybe you trust people too easily or it's just bad luck, but every client who walks into your office has some double deal, hidden agenda, or scam they're running.|
|4|. You have a reputation for taking on clients who can't afford your services. Every hard-luck case ends up at your door, whether you want them or not.|
|5|. In a world where the rights of warforged are not always certain, you take up their cause.|
|6|. When a criminal has been wronged but doesn't want to be brought to justice they come to you, trusting (rightly or wrongly) that you won't turn them in.|
