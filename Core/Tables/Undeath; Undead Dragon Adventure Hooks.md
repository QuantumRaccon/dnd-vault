### Undead Dragon Adventure Hooks
---
|d6|Adventure Hook|
|----|------------|
|1|A dragon seeks help, desperate to prevent a dracolich-worshiping cult from convincing the dragon's sibling, mate, or rival to become a dracolich.|
|2|A dragon suffering from a wasting affliction asks the characters to travel to another world, where they must destroy an echo of that dragon who has become a dracolich.|
|3|A pirate crew under the command of a [[ghost dragon]] fights to recover the dead dragon's scattered hoard.|
|4|A [[hollow dragon]] guards an artifact meant to be used in the dire circumstances foretold in an ancient prophecy. Now the prophecy is coming to pass, but the dragon won't let the artifact be used for its intended purpose.|
|5|A gem dragon from another world is searching for the dragon's echo, which has become a [[draconic shard]].|
|6|A dracolich keeps returning after being destroyed. The dracolich's connection to its echoes on other worlds is keeping its soul intact, like a phylactery, and the connection must be severed before the creature's threat can be ended.|
