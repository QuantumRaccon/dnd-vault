### Eberron Crafting Complications
---
|d6|Complication|
|----|------------|
|1|House Cannith or another dragonmarked house takes an interest in your work. Do they view you as a threat, or are they impressed by your techniques?|
|2|A mishap creates a temporary manifest zone (see "" in  for information on manifest zones).|
|3|You need to acquire an additional rare component to complete your work. Time for adventure!|
|4|The shifting balance of the planes interferes with your work; you must wait for the current planar alignment to change. This delays your work by **2d6** days.|
|5|Your efforts draw the attention of the Aurum, the Chamber, the Emerald Claw, or the Lords of Dust.|
|6|Your item becomes sentient (see chapter 7 of the  for rules on sentient items).|
