### Memorable Mission
---
|d4|Mission|
|----|------------|
|1|. A former associate turned against you. You escaped, and want revenge.|
|2| Things went wrong, and you had to make the terrible decision to abandon an ally. They might be dead, or they might be looking for revenge.|
|3|. Your actions made headlines across Khorvaire, shaping history for the next decade. Nobody knows you were involved, and sometimes you wish you could have a little credit for your work.|
|4|. You met your match during a tense operation. Neither side got everything they wanted. You hate to admit it, but the team you went up against proved your match. Maybe you'll cross paths again.|
