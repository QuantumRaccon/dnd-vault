|1|. You have evidence of a career-ending secret concerning an important figure.|
|2|. You are party to a conspiracy that seeks to influence events to better suit your desires.|
|3|. You have damning information on your patron agency, but it has carefully collected equally damaging secrets on all of you.|
|4|. A local organization, such as a guild, government, or dragonmarked house, is engaged in dirty deeds, and you have inside information on them.|
|5|. You know the secret identity of a seemingly innocent but powerful person who would rather remain anonymous.|
|6|. Rumors say you collect damaging secrets on anyone, and people tread carefully around you as a result. The truth is that your reputation is overblown, so you have your own secret to keep safe.|
