---
|d6|Encounter|
|----|------------|
|1|The characters encounter **1d4** wildfolk [[Scout]] hunting a [[saber-toothed tiger]]. The scouts are out of arrows and willing to trade equipment and information to replenish their ammunition.|
|2|The characters encounter a lost Cerberus Assembly [[mage]] trying to return to Balenpost. The rest of the mage's team died in the ruins of Aeor, and there is a 50 percent chance the mage carries a recently recovered Aeorian item.|
|3|The characters find a [[griffon]] with an arrow in its wing that prevents it from flying. A character who succeeds on a DC 15 Wisdom ([[Animal Handling]]) check can approach the griffon without being attacked. Such a character can remove the arrow, restoring the griffon's ability to fly, after which the griffon allows the character to ride it as a mount for the next **1d10** days.|
|4|The characters encounter the [[revenant]] of a dead explorer from Balenpost who was murdered by one of its team and is looking for vengeance.|
|5|The characters find a 3-foot-tall, 50-pound egg. If they keep the egg in a cold environment for **1d10** weeks, a [[white dragon wyrmling]] hatches from it.|
|6|A [[young remorhaz]] ambushes the characters.|
