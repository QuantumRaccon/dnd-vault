### Deep Dragon Ideals
---
|d6|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Understanding. True power comes from the ability to discern other creatures' motivations better than they can discern yours. (Any)|
|2|Kindred. All dragons are kin to one another, and we would all do well to prioritize that kinship. (Any)|
|3|Mystery. I appreciate a question I cannot answer, so I strive to be an enigma for other creatures. (Any)|
|4|Adaptability. Whether taking on a new form, making new allies, or trying a new strategy, flexibility keeps one youthful. (Chaotic)|
|5|Superiority. Weaker creatures cannot be trusted, so I constantly remind my servants of my power. (Evil)|
|6|Patience. All creatures might teach me something, and I'm willing to wait and find out what that might be rather than acting in haste. (Good)|
