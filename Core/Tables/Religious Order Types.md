|1|. This community of scholars and monster hunters laboriously researches the unquiet dead, tracking them to their lairs and permanently laying them to rest.|
|2|. This federation prizes knowledge and texts pertaining to their god. They collect rare holy books and record the life stories of miracle-working prophets.|
|3|. This order of archaeologist-monks seeks to fill their museum-like temple with storied holy relics.|
|4|. Adhering to the belief that religion empowers civilization, this order travels far to help the downtrodden, seeking to draw new believers by their virtuous example.|
|5|. This dogmatically rigid hierarchy seeks to stamp out all threats to their beliefs.|
|6|. This order believes the world is about to end. They're convinced that if they persuade everyone else of this fact they might stave off the impending doom.|
