### Lamannia Manifest Zone Features
---
|d4|Feature|
|----|------------|
|1|Spells that summon elementals are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.|
|2|The forces of nature work to tear down anything built within the zone. Weather, vegetation, and a rapid rate of decay combine to quickly destroy structures built in the region and overgrow the ruins.|
|3|The zone is dominated by towering trees and thick undergrowth. Animals come from the surrounding area to live in the zone, where they grow larger and stronger than usual for their species.|
|4|What appears to be a circle of stones is in truth a group of slumbering earth elementals that came from Lamannia during its most recent coterminous period.|
