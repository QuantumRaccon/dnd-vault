|1|A hidden floor of the royal library|
|2|The ninth basement beneath a family home that seems normal from the outside|
|3|A decrepit manor, empty save for staff who swear the lord is merely preoccupied|
|4|A small inn in the mountains that smells perpetually of brine|
|5|The place in the forest where all the animals come to die|
|6|A fortress manned by paladins, all of whom removed their own tongues|
|7|A sewage system that predates the city above|
|8|A thin chapel in the woods, whose bells rings without ceasing|
