|d6|Quality|Effect|
|----|----|----------|
|1|Perilous|The area is dangerously worn and prone to collapse. Any impacts or damage to the structure, including from spells and other areas of effect, have a 50 percent chance of causing a collapse (see the [[Improvising Damage]] table).|
|2|Crumbling|Areas within the dungeon section are choked with rubble and have a 50 percent chance of being [[difficult terrain]]. Half cover and hiding places are plentiful.|
|3|Neglected|One dungeon hazard such as [[brown mold]], [[yellow mold]], or [[green slime]] is abundant.|
|4|Abandoned|Most of the dungeon is deserted and quiet as a tomb. Dexterity ([[Stealth]]) checks have disadvantage because any sounds stand out as unusual.|
|5|Secure|Ability checks made to break down doors, open locks, or similar breaking and entering activities have disadvantage.|
|6|Thriving|The dungeon is heavily populated. Any loud noises or other attention-drawing phenomena require a check for Dungeon Encounters (see below).|
