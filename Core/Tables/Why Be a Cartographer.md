### Why Be a Cartographer?
---
|d8|Reason|
|----|------------|
|1|A paranoid person by nature, you like seeing what's ahead of you at all times.|
|2|Your parent was a cartographer, their parent was a cartographer, and by the gods, you're going to be one too.|
|3|You're fairly certain no one else in your party even knows how to hold a map, let alone read one.|
|4|You like spyglasses. A lot.|
|5|Your nickname as a child was "the cartography kid."|
|6|Contrary to popular opinion, the destination is much, much more important than the journey.|
|7|A good map is like an adventure without the bugs. And the mud. And the wolves.|
|8|You suffer from the nagging feeling of never knowing why you've come into a room, and you need the professional flourish that lets you cover for that.|
