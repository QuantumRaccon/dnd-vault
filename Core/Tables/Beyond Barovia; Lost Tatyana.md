### Lost Tatyana
---
|d6|Resurrection Circumstances|
|----|------------|
|1|Tatyana's incorporeal spirit assembles and haunts heroes whom she believes have the best chance of defeating Strahd.|
|2|A character's friend or loved one is the incarnation of Tatyana. When the Mists claim that individual, the character is drawn into Barovia as well.|
|3|A character's own reincarnation allows Tatyana's soul to enter their body, bringing with it memories in the form of vivid dreams.|
|4|Tatyana's soul was captured by an effect similar to the [[magic jar]] spell. Strahd or another entity hires the characters to seek out the container holding the soul, not revealing its true nature.|
|5|Tatyana's soul reincarnated as someone another Darklord covets, such as the bearer of Ankhtepot's ka in  or [[Elise]] in  (both detailed later in this chapter).|
|6|Tatyana's soul found its way into a distant relative of Strahd, Lyssa von Zarovich. Lyssa seeks to grow more powerful and claim Castle Ravenloft for herself. Her first step to deposing Strahd was to become a [[vampire]]. Now she needs allies.|
