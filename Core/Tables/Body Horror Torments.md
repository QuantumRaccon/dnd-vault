|2|The Darklord suffers ever-growing, tumorous organs, the mass expanding beyond them to choke their dwelling.|
|3|The Darklord possesses a second starving mouth in their torso, one that howls unless fed.|
|4|The Darklord can't control their transformation into a beast and back.|
|5|The voices of those the Darklord have wronged scream endlessly from inside them.|
|6|The Darklord aches daily with a monstrous, unceasing hunger.|
