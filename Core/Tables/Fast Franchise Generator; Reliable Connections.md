|1|: The best fence in town.|
|2|: The most easily intimidated customs official in the city. From blueprints of government buildings to shipping manifests, he's your halfling.|
|3|: A dab hand at knitting and swinging a sword. He takes payment in liquor for either service.|
|4|: Noble who wants to play criminal; enthusiastic, inexperienced, and loaded.|
|5|: The only thing known about this information broker is the dead-drop point where they exchange messages, and that they're never wrong.|
|6|: If you're looking for a place to lie low, her funeral home is ideal.|
|7|: Always has a job for those looking to scrape together a few coins. Unfortunately, his teeth outnumber his scruples.|
|8|: Famous for being able to get goods and people past any blockade. Provided you don't mind said goods or people smelling strongly of mustard for the next month.|
