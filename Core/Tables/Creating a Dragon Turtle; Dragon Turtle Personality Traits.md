|----|------------|
|1|I speak slowly and deliberately, pausing to reflect after (or sometimes in the middle of) each utterance.|
|2|I am more interested in the shiny baubles people carry than in anything they have to say.|
|3|I think of ships as kindred spirits and like to rub affectionately against their keels.|
|4|I like to show visitors the vastness of my domain, so they appreciate how insignificant they are.|
|5|I attack anyone I notice taking from the sea's bounty without offering something in return.|
|6|I think of sailors' songs as their "water speech" and try to converse with them by humming snippets of tunes I have overheard.|
|7|I swim alongside ships sailing through my domain, just out of arrow range, so they know I am watching.|
|8|I am fascinated by the politics of surface realms and talk endlessly with sailors and adventurers to stay current on the latest happenings on land.|
