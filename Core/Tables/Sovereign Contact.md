|1|. The sovereign's friend or lover seeks to aid their companion in any way possible.|
|2|. An intelligence operative attends to the nation's dirty work so the sovereign keeps their hands clean.|
|3|. This severe bureaucrat disagrees with many of the sovereign's policies but takes loyal service seriously.|
|4|. The responsibilities of an exacting butler or other servant at the royal household far exceed their title.|
|5|. A semi-retired, leisure-loving ambassador speaks in suggestion and innuendo.|
|6|. A ghostly council of the nation's previous regents manifests to avert disasters.|
