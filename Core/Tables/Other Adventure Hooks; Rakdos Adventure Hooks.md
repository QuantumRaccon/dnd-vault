---
|d6|Adventure Hook|
|----|------------|
|1|Wild-eyed people attending a popular new club seem unwilling or unable to go home after several days of nonstop merriment.|
|2|One morning, everyone who has seen a [[Rakdos]] performance in the past week suddenly transforms into a minor demon.|
|3|An apparently spontaneous [[Rakdos]]-led riot has spread to take over an entire neighborhood.|
|4|People who die in [[Rakdos]]-inspired violence stand back up as [[Zombie]] and keep fighting.|
|5|Ordinary knives and chains in homes across the neighborhood seem to come to life in advance of the start of a [[Rakdos]] show.|
|6|After several mausoleums are burst open from the inside, people see their undead family members cavorting on a [[Rakdos]] stage.|
