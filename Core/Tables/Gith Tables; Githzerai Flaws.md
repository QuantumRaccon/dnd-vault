### Githzerai Flaws
---
|d4|Flaw|
|----|------------|
|1|I see githyanki machinations behind every threat.|
|2|I believe in the supremacy of the gith and that githzerai and githyanki will align to rule the multiverse.|
|3|I respond to even minor threats with overwhelming displays of force.|
|4|The next time I laugh will be the first. The sound of merriment takes me to the edge of violence.|
