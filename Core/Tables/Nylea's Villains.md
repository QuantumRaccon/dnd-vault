|1|A Setessan hunt-leader ([[Setessan hoplite]]; see ) swears vengeance on a poacher in the Nessian Wood who turns out to be an Akroan general.|
|2|A [[hydra]] goes on a rampage at the edge of the forest. It must be dealt with, but a [[druid]] follower of Nylea will take vengeance on anyone who kills it outright.|
|3|A [[mage]] who lives in a secluded grove has been using a magic item to transform interlopers into boars. She claims that Nylea gave her this item.|
