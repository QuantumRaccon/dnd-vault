|----|------------|
|1|. You are seen as righteous crusaders, upholding the highest ideals of your faith and doing the gods' work in the world. Your deeds and methods are rarely, if ever, questioned.|
|2|. Your behavior and beliefs are in line with the hierarchy's expectations. As long as you stay in line, no one gives you trouble.|
|3|. You attract unwanted attention to your order or hierarchy from outside, so you are under a great deal of pressure to keep a low profile.|
|4|. You flout the dictates of your hierarchyâ€”even if it's for just reasons. Your superiors constantly try to rein you in.|
|5|. You bring a much-needed breath of fresh air into the ranks of your faith. If only more people of faith would act as you do!|
|6|. For right or wrong, your behavior and beliefs are viewed as unacceptable, and the hierarchy of your faith actively opposes your work.|
