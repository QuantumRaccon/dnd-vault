### Nemesis
---
|d6|Nemesis|
|----|------------|
|1|. You lost a lot of friends in battle, but what made it worse was watching that cackling wizard raise them as zombies and turn them against you.|
|2|. As prisoners of war, you were captured and subjected to brutal conditions in a prisoner camp. The commandant delighted in your pain.|
|3|. Your friends would still be alive if one incompetent officer with political power and influential allies hadn't sent you on a disastrous mission.|
|4|. You were among those who survived an encounter with a warforged colossus. Cyre or House Cannith—whoever was responsible for such a nightmare—deserves whatever evil fate comes their way.|
|5|. A band of traitorous mercenaries who switched sides, turning the battle against you.|
|6|. One mighty hero fought on the enemy side, wielding powerful magic and cruel strategies against the rank-and-file soldiers on your side.|
