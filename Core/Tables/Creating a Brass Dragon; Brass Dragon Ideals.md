### Brass Dragon Ideals
---
|d6|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Curiosity. The best way to show you value others is to learn as much as you can about them. (Good)|
|2|Perspective. Everyone sees things differently, so if you want to know about the world, gather as many different points of view as you can. (Any)|
|3|Knowledge. What's the point of living for centuries if you don't learn all there is to know? (Any)|
|4|Self-Determination. All creatures have the right to make their own decisions about their lives and ultimate destinies. (Chaotic)|
|5|Compassion. Sharing each other's pain and loss brings us all closer to peace and unity. (Good)|
|6|Cruelty. The most hilarious thing about lesser creatures who think they're important is how outraged they get when I hurt them. (Evil)|
