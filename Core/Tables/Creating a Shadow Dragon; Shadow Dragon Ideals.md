### Shadow Dragon Ideals
---
|d6|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Merciless. Life doesn't offer second chances, and neither do I. (Lawful)|
|2|Hedonism. The multiverse is painful enough. Seek pleasure wherever you can find it. (Chaotic)|
|3|Cruelty. The only release for my pain is to visit it upon others. (Evil)|
|4|Aspiration. I will one day find an escape from this condemnation. (Any)|
|5|Self-Serving. The petty concerns of other creatures are of no concern to me. I have enough to occupy my attention. (Neutral)|
|6|Compassion. My existence is misery, and no one else should have to suffer such torment. (Good)|
