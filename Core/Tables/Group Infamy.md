|1|. Each member of your group has a distinct tattoo that inspires fear in others. When possible, you use the symbol as a calling card to mark your work.|
|2|. Whether it is a leather duster with a group symbol or a distinctive handkerchief tucked in your pocket, your gang has a signature accessory.|
|3|. Your group is linked to an infamous crime, one that remains the talk of the town.|
|4|. A certain type of person finds criminals alluring, and your band has acquired a group of such hangers-on. They're not criminals themselves, just outsiders who admire you for your brutality, cunning, or flair.|
|5|. The Boromar Clan has a legitimate front, though everyone knows the truth behind it. You're part of that facade of legitimacy, but you have a reputation for getting away with (literal) murder.|
|6|. You have an air of mystery, and people whisper that you command strange powers. True or not, this reputation keeps people out of your way.|
