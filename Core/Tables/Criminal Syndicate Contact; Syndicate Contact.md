### Syndicate Contact
---
|d6|Contact|
|----|------------|
|1|. This longtime member of the syndicate took you under their wing when you were young and became a parental figure.|
|2|. An innocuous person, perhaps a beggar or menial laborer, knows all the right people and shares their connections with you.|
|3|. Your contact used to be (or maybe still is) a member of local law enforcement. They have sharp insight into the law's workings in your area and a healthy dose of paranoia for that reason.|
|4|. The boss of a local den of vice—whether gambling, narcotics, or other pleasures—aids you when they're not distracted by their own debauchery.|
|5|. You know your contact in the syndicate has betrayed it, but they have enough clout and leverage that you don't dare cross them—yet.|
|6|. Unknown to most, your contact is a member of local nobility or royalty. Why they maintain relations with the syndicate is a troubling mystery.|
