### Group Rivals

|d6|Rival|
|----|------------|
|1|. Someone in the Sharn Watch has vowed to put you in prison or die trying.|
|2|. Some members of a rival syndicate (such as Daask, House Tarkanan, or the Tyrants) hate you, probably for good reason.|
|3|. Your group's adventures make for great headlines. Your every move is reported in the broadsheets and your steps are dogged by journalists.|
|4|. Another group within the Boromar Clan is jealous of your success or angry about a past wrong. They do everything they can to undercut you.|
|5|. A citizen you wronged has sworn vengeance. Around any corner, you might find yourself facing a vigilante or a posse of angry citizens out for your blood.|
|6|. The halfling family in control of the syndicate has its eye on you, taking pains to keep you in line and make sure you stay loyal.|
