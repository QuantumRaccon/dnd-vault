### Syrania Manifest Zone Features
---
|d4|Feature|
|----|------------|
|1|This zone suppresses all aggressive thought. Any creature that wants to make an attack or cast a damaging spell must succeed on a DC 13 Wisdom saving throw or it doesn't make the attack or cast the spell, but loses its action.|
|2|Those with great will and fortitude who ascend a mountain peak in this area can try to bend the weather for miles around to their will, as if they had cast the [[control weather]] spell.|
|3|In this sun-dappled field, children—as well as free-spirited, childlike folk—find themselves able to fly for 1 hour.|
|4|A village is built into the side of a cliff face here. Windmills protruding from the cliff collect energy from the power of the wind, which is used to operate elevators throughout the community.|
