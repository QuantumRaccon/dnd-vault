|Check Total|Benefit|
|----|------------|
|1–5|The participant uncovers deep-seated issues between themself and their chosen partner. If this is a character, they have disadvantage on ability checks made in the presence of the partner until the character undertakes this activity again. If this is a staff member, they are traumatized and leave the franchise unless the characters can convince them to stay.|
|6–10|The participant did not benefit from the team building exercise, but avoided serious trauma.|
|11–15|The participant was able to work through one or more issues. If this is a character, they have advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity.|
|16–20|The participant sees themself and their connection to the other participant in a whole new way. If this is a character, they have advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity, and they gain a team building memory (see below).|
|21+|The participant has had an awakening, gaining a deep sense of who they can become and their connection to their partner. The character has advantage on the next check they make during a franchise or downtime activity, and gains two team building memories.|
