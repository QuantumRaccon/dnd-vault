|d6|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Isolation. Territories can be properly established only when all parties respect the borders of their neighbors. (Lawful)|
|2|Control. All lesser beings should bare their throats to their betters. (Evil)|
|3|Respect. Fear is amusing, but reverence is delicious. (Any)|
|4|Intrigue. The world is so much more entertaining when no one trusts anyone. (Evil)|
|5|Imagination. Nothing is more gauche than repeating the same activities day after day. (Any)|
|6|Tolerance. The impermanence of intelligent life is bittersweet and should be honored as such. (Good)|
