|1|It's a flip stone.|
|2|It gets great reception everywhere except in your headquarters.|
|3|It sometimes picks up other magical conversations.|
|4|It's the perfect size, shape, and weight to be used as a skipping stone.|
|5|It heats up when you use it, to the extent that it once burned through your gloves.|
|6|It has an obnoxious ringtone that you can't work out how to change.|
|7|It fails to notify you of incoming messages except for a faint pulsating glow.|
|8|It's voice activated, so that every time you talk to someone, it tries to send a message to someone else.|
