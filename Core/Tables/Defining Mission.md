|1|. You knew if you took one step back from the line, all would be lost. When relief arrived days later, you had not budged.|
|2|. The enemy general never knew what hit them. You still carry their personal flag as a trophy.|
|3|. You traveled hundreds of miles around enemy lines to reach your target. In a single day, months of enemy preparation went up in flames.|
|4|. During a key battle, you were part of a heroic push to break the enemy line.|
|5|. You were at the forefront of a daring assault to liberate a captured citadel or town.|
|6|. The enemy's secret attack would've been devastating. Luckily, you spotted it in time.|
