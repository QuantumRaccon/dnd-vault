### Bronze Dragon Ideals
---
|d6|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Action. Passivity is shameful. We owe it to the world and ourselves to try to improve things, even if we can't guarantee success. (Any)|
|2|Analysis. When possible, dig into the root of a conflict before committing to end it, to ensure you aren't fighting for the wrong side. (Any)|
|3|Honor. I never lie outright, though I choose my words carefully. I will fight to the death rather than break my word or abandon a comrade. (Lawful)|
|4|Discipline. Disorganization breeds defeat. I demand self-control from both myself and those who fight beside me. (Lawful)|
|5|Guardianship. It's the duty of the strong to protect the weak. (Good)|
|6|Dominance. Anyone who opposes my will is either an underling to be punished or an enemy to be vanquished. (Evil)|
