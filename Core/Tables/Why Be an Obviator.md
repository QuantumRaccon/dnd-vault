|d8|Reason|
|----|------------|
|1|There's nothing that excites you more than a puzzle you can't immediately solve.|
|2|Your favorite saying is, "All according to plan." Especially when you have no idea what's going on.|
|3|You have an entire room dedicated to notes and sketches connected by red yarn.|
|4|Your plans are so detailed that they have plans of their own.|
|5|You find the little details so much more interesting than... well, anything else.|
|6|You already had the chemical burns on your hands. Might as well make it official.|
|7|Methodical. Calculating. Brilliant. One day, you hope these words will apply to you.|
|8|It's not paranoia if they really are out to get you. And if you're out to get them first.|
