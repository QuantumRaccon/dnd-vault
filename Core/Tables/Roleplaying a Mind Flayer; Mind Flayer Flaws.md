|1|I am oblivious to the emotions expressed by others.|
|2|I believe my minions will always do precisely as I intend.|
|3|I never assume others understand and always explain everything.|
|4|I have a memory that isn't mine. I'm obsess about it.|
|5|It is inconceivable that another creature could outsmart me.|
|6|I sometimes confuse others' thoughts with my own.|
