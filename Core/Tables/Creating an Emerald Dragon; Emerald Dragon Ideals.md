### Emerald Dragon Ideals
---
|d6|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Seclusion. It's safer if others don't know I'm hereâ€”safer for me and safer for them. (Any)|
|2|Observation. People lie. Histories lie. Even dragons lie. But actions always ring true. (Lawful)|
|3|Storytelling. There is a magic in the retelling of stories. Each new teller adds a bit of themself to the spell. (Any)|
|4|Nurture. Rearing a child is our best chance to make sure our own stories are passed on. (Any)|
|5|Inquisitiveness. Even the smallest village contains myriad stories of love, loss, triumph, and betrayal. There is always more to learn about people. (Any)|
|6|Espionage. Once I get paid for the information I glean, I don't care what others do with it. (Evil)|
