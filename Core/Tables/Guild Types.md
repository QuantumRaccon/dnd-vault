|----|------------|
|1|. This conglomerate of artisans pools its resources and influence to ensure a steady exchange of gold for its crafts.|
|2|. These entrepreneurs don't create the wares they peddle, instead specializing in linking products to prospective owners. If they don't have it, they find it.|
|3|. The magically inclined crafters of this guild specialize in imbuing physical goods with magical effects. Rumor has it they can strip the magic from existing enchanted items and might be willing to buy or trade adventurers' spoils.|
|4|. These merchants deal in all forms of currency, acting as bankers, loan agents, and crucial contacts for adventurers and other individuals who deal with large sums of wealth. They exchange coin for gemstones as readily as they find buyers for historical relics and recovered art.|
|5|. These like-minded individuals follow specific teachings, spreading word of their expertise through their services and training.|
|6|. These enigmatic dealers buy and sell documents, memories, and the trappings of thoroughly lived lives, selling them to those in need of the ultimate fresh start.|
