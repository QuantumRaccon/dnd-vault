### Shavarath Manifest Zone Features
---
|d4|Feature|
|----|------------|
|1|Blades crafted here have a reputation for being especially fine and sharp. When a creature in the zone scores a critical hit with an attack that deals piercing or slashing damage, the attack deals one additional die of damage.|
|2|Blood spilled here never washes away. Any Charisma checks made in the zone to avoid hostility are made with disadvantage; Charisma checks made to encourage violence are always successful.|
|3|Storms of whirling blades cut the sky during times of combat, randomly attacking the participants. The effect is the same as that of the [[cloud of daggers]] spell, but the area and the damage might both increase.|
|4|Devils, demons, and angels duel in the remains of a ruined fortress that serves as a portal to Shavarath.|
