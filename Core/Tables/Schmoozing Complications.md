### Schmoozing Complications
---
|d6|Complication|
|----|------------|
|1|A different group notices the character's schmoozing attempts. Agents threaten to expose the franchise's ulterior motives unless the characters perform a favor or pay a bribe.* |
|2|To win over a potential contact, the schmoozing character or staff member swore to participate in an initiation ritual from the contact's group... without first learning the nature of that ritual.|
|3|A contact becomes convinced that the schmoozing character or staff member intends to leave the franchise and join the contact's organization. It's clear that they'll become hurt or angry when they learn the truth.|
|4|In the attempt to win over a contact, it was necessary to reveal one of the franchise's secrets.* |
|5|The character or staff member regrets giving a contact a personal item, a drop of blood, or a lock of hair. It seemed like a great idea at the time.* |
|6|Shortly after schmoozing, the character or staff member receives a love letter from a contactâ€”whether that interest is reciprocated or not.* |
