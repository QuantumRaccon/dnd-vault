### Marketeering Complications
---
|d8|Complication|
|----|------------|
|1|The marketeering plan attracts the attention of Head Office, where someone absolutely hates it. A NPC is sent to oversee the franchise "for a while," with an outcome determined by the DM.* |
|2|Marketeering materials go missing right before launch, forcing the franchise to recreate them at the last minute. This might incur additional baseline costs or affect the reduction of franchise costs, as the DM determines.* |
|3|Just as the marketeering plan is released to the public, the characters realize that a competing group released a surprisingly similar plan just a tenday previous. Customers now think the franchise is copying its rival.* |
|4|The marketeering's message alienates or offends a crucial demographic. Protests spring up, and the affected group demands reparations.|
|5|A local official or noble begins to look into claims of deceptive advertising tactics or questionable hiring practices related to the marketeering plan.* |
|6|The marketeering plan creates great interestâ€”but unfortunately steers customers toward similar products or services offered by a competitor.* |
|7|The catchphrase or theme song of the marketeering campaign is a surprise hit, and everyone repeats it endlessly! Until they tire of it and begin blaming the franchise for mental trauma.|
|8|The marketeering plan is undermined by rumors of a problem with the product or service, causing it to be dangerous to anyone using it.* |
