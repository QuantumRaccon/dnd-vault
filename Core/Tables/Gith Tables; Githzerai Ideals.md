### Githzerai Ideals
---
|d4|Ideal|
|----|------------|
|1|Faith. Zerthimon shall return, and I will be worthy to walk beside him.|
|2|Courage. The mind can master anything if it is unfettered by fear.|
|3|Duty. My people survive only because those like me place their needs above our own.|
|4|Freedom. No strong soul should be enslaved. Better to die first than live as another's puppet.|
