### Wilderness Chase Complications
---
|d20|Complication|
|----|------------|
|1|Your path takes you through a rough patch of brush. Make a DC 10 Strength ([[Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check (your choice) to get past the brush. On failed check, the brush counts as 5feet of [[difficult terrain]].|
|2|Uneven ground threatens to slow your progress. Make a DC 10 Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check to navigate the area. On failed check, the ground counts as 10 feet of [[difficult terrain]].|
|3|You run through a [[swarm of insects]] (see the Monster Manual For game statistics). The swarm makes an opportunity attack against you (+3 to hit; **4d4** piercing damage on a hit).|
|4|A stream, ravine, or rock bed blocks your path. Make a DC 10 Strength ([[Athletics]]) or Dexterity ([[Acrobatics]]) check (your choice) to cross the impediment. On a failed check, the impediment counts as 10 feet of [[difficult terrain]].|
|5|Make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw. Ona failed save, you are [[blinded]] by blowing sand,dirt, ash, snow,or pollen until the end of your turn. While [[blinded]] in this way, your speed is halved.|
|6|A sudden drop catches you by surprise. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw to navigate the impediment. On failed save, you fall **1d4 x 5** feet, taking **1d6** bludgeoning damage per 10 feet fallen as normal, and land [[prone]].|
|7|You blunder into a snare. Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On failed save, you are caught in the snare and [[restrained]]. As an action, you or someone within 5 feet of you can make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing you on a success. The snare can also be destroyed; it has an AC of 10 and 5 hit points, and it is immune to poison and psychic damage. Complication|
|8|You are caught in a stampede of spooked animals. Make a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw. Ona failed save, you are knocked about and take **1d4** bludgeoning damage and **1d4** piercing damage.|
|9|Your path takes you near a patch of razorvine. Make a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or use 10 feet of movement (your choice) to avoid the razorvine. On a failed save, you take **1d10** slashing damage.|
|10|One or more creatures in the area chase after you! The DM chooses these pursuers or rolls a **d8** to determine them: (1) 2 [[brown bear]], (2) **2d4** [[giant toad]], (3) **1d4** [[poisonous snake]], (4) **2d4** [[wolf]], (5) 1 [[giant boar]], (6) 2 [[dire wolf]], (7) [[griffon]], or (8) **1d12** [[giant rat]] (see the  for the creatures' game statistics).|
