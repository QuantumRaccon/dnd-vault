### Memorable Majordomos
---
|d6|Majordomo|
|----|------------|
|1|A consummate professional. No amount of blood, gore, or viscera will keep them from completing their duties.|
|2|A sinister figure who sticks to the shadows and respond always to requests with, "Yes, master."|
|3|The ghost of the previous owner. They do a terrible job and refer to all prospective clients as trespassers.|
|4|A brusque, deaf, retired military captain.|
|5|An incredibly cheerful chef, who insists that no business is more pressing than a full belly.|
|6|A druid that keeps an open door policy for any and all animals seeking shelter. Their cleaning policy is less rigorous.|
