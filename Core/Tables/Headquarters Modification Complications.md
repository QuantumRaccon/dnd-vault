### Headquarters Modification Complications
---
|d6|Complication|
|----|------------|
|1|An accident during the modification injures a franchise staff member. That NPC's family demands compensation equal to 100 gp per franchise rank. It might be possible to instead appease the family by performing a service.|
|2|A spy makes a copy of the plans for the modification, learning its function and taking that information back to a rival organization.* |
|3|The modification was based on information originating with a rival. If the modification failed, the plans were intentionally faulty. If it succeeded, the characters detected the fault, but must decide how to respond to the attempted sabotage.* |
|4|A local official insists that permits were needed for the modification, and demands payment or a favor to make the problem go away.* |
|5|The work causes the franchise headquarters to develop a quirk, such as strange noises, unwelcome smells, weird vibrations while mobile, and the like. Resolving the problem might require consulting a sage or an expert in headquarters construction.|
|6|The modification work uncovers a previously unknown problem with the headquarters, such as a structural defect, a dormant monster, bodies interred in the foundations, a concealed cursed item, and so forth.|
