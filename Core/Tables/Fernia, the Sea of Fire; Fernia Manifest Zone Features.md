|d4|Feature|
|----|------------|
|1|Spells that deal fire damage are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone deals fire damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.|
|2|Weapons and armor with unusual abilities can be forged here, though their enchantments are not always stable.|
|3|The area is dotted with pools of molten earth and fissures of scalding water, from which mephits and elementals emerge with regularity.|
|4|Motes of [[continual flame]] are spontaneously generated in this region, typically attached to some vegetation or minerals from the area. These flames persist even if they are removed from the region.|
