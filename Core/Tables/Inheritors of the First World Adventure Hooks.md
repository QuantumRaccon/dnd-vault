---
|d6|Adventure Hook|
|----|------------|
|1|A fleeing foe disappears into a magic portal linked to another world of the Material Plane. When the characters follow this enemy, they draw the attention of dragons who want to know more about the world they came from.|
|2|The lair of a gem dragon turns out to be a magical nexus containing portals linked to the lairs of the dragon's echoes on several other worlds.|
|3|The characters discover an enormous ruby deep in the Underdark. When word of their find gets out, the gem becomes the target of thieves and eventually of dragons who believe it is the heart of Sardior and a key to the Ruby Dragon's return.|
|4|A dragon offers to pay the characters handsomely if they travel to another world. There, they must make contact with the dragon's echo and solve the mystery of why their patron has been unable to learn dragonsight.|
|5|Priests or dragon servitors of Bahamut send the characters to combat the Inheritors of the First World, worried that any attempt to restore Bahamut and Tiamat's primal creation will anger the gods and rekindle the ancient wars between dragons and Humanoids.|
|6|Dragons establish a permanent portal connecting two worlds of the Material Plane, establishing an exciting era of discovery and trade between them. But the longer the portal remains open, the larger it grows, seemingly drawing the two worlds together into a catastrophic collision.|
