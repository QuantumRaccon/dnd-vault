### Risia Manifest Zone Features
---
|d4|Feature|
|----|------------|
|1|Spells that deal cold damage are empowered here. Such a spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone deals cold damage as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.|
|2|Veins of cobalt-blue ice run through a glacier in the area. If extracted, this ice maintains its temperature and doesn't melt. An object carved from it can function as a spellcasting focus for spells dealing with water or ice.|
|3|Abominable yetis lair in a network of bitterly cold, frost-rimed caves in the mountains.|
|4|Any spell that deals fire damage deals just half the normal damage.|
