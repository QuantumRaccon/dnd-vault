### Dolurrh Manifest Zone Features
---
|d4|Feature|
|----|------------|
|1|Bodies buried here reanimate in **1d4** days, possessed by restless spirits. These spirits might be malevolent or benign.|
|2|Any necromancy spell of 1st level or higher cast within the zone is treated as if it were cast at a level one higher than the spell slot that was expended.|
|3|Spells and abilities that raise the dead have a 50 percent chance to bring back **1d4** angry spirits as well. These might be banshees, ghosts, shadows, specters, wraiths, or other incorporeal undead.|
|4|In order to cast a spell of 1st level or higher in the zone, the caster must succeed on a Constitution check with a DC equal to 10 + the level of the spell. On a failed check, the spell is not cast and its spell slot is not expended, but the action is lost.|
