|3|Three Casques Silencieux ([[animated armor]]) gesture for the character to get indoors immediately. They turn hostile if the character resists.|

|5|A [[swarm of rats]] shadows the character as they travel. If confronted, the swarm attacks. Anyone bitten by the rats must succeed on a DC 14 Constitution saving throw or contract the Gnawing Plague.|
|6|A young, well-heeled couple cavorts openly, oblivious to the quarantine. These [[Wererat]] don't reveal their true nature unless they must, and then only to blend in with the swarms of rats.|
