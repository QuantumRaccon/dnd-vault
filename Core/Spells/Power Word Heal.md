A wave of healing energy washes over the creature you touch. The target regains all its hit points. If the creature is [[charmed]], [[frightened]], [[paralyzed]], or [[stunned]], the condition ends. If the creature is [[prone]], it can use its reaction to stand up. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
