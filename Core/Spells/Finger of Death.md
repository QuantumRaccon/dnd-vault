_7th-level Necromancy_
**Casting Time**:: 1 action
**Range**:: 60 feet
**Components**:: V, S
**Duration**:: Instantaneous

---

You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes **7d8 + 30** necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your next turn as a [[zombie]] that is permanently under your command, following your verbal orders to the best of its ability.
