You fill the air with spinning daggers in a cube 5 feet on each side, centered on a point you choose within range. A creature takes **4d4** slashing damage when it enters the spell's area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there.


**_At Higher Levels_**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the damage increases by **2d4** for each slot level above 2nd.
