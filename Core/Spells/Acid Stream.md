A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell's duration or until a creature uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off itself or another creature. A creature covered in the acid takes **3d4** acid damage at start of each of its turns.


**_At Higher Levels_**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by **1d4** for each slot level above 1st.
