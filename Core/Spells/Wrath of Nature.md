You call out to the spirits of nature to rouse them against your enemies. Choose a point you can see within range. The spirits cause trees, rocks, and grasses in a 60-foot cube centered on that point to become animated until the spell ends.


**_Grasses and Undergrowth_**. Any area of ground in the cube that is covered by grass or undergrowth is [[difficult terrain]] for your enemies.

**_Trees_**. At the start of each of your turns, each of your enemies within 10 feet of any tree in the cube must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or take **4d6** slashing damage from whipping branches.

**_Roots and Vines_**. At the end of each of your turns, one creature of your choice that is on the ground in the cube must succeed on a Strength saving throw or become [[restrained]] until the spell ends. A [[restrained]] creature can use an action to make a Strength ([[Athletics]]) check against your spell save DC, ending the effect on itself on a success.

**_Rocks_**. As a bonus action on your turn, you can cause a loose rock in the cube to launch at a creature you can see in the cube. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes **3d8** nonmagical bludgeoning damage, and it must succeed on a Strength saving throw or fall [[prone]].
