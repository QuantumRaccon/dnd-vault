You sacrifice some of your health to mend another creature's injuries. You take **4d8** necrotic damage, which can't be reduced in any way, and one creature of your choice that you can see within range regains a number of hit points equal to twice the necrotic damage you take.


**_At Higher Levels_**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by **1d8** for each slot level above 3rd.
