**_Bull's Strength_**. The target has advantage on Strength checks, and his or her carrying capacity doubles.

**_Cat's Grace_**. The target has advantage on Dexterity checks. It also doesn't take damage from falling 20 feet or less if it isn't [[incapacitated]].

**_Eagle's Splendor_**. The target has advantage on Charisma checks.

**_Fox's Cunning_**. The target has advantage on Intelligence checks.

**_Owl's Wisdom_**. The target has advantage on Wisdom checks.
