The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends, the weapon gleams with astral radiance as you strike. The attack deals an extra **2d6** radiant damage to the target, which becomes visible if it's [[invisible]], and the target sheds dim light in a 5-foot radius and can't become [[invisible]] until the spell ends.


**_At Higher Levels_**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or higher, the extra damage increases by **1d6** for each slot level above 2nd.
