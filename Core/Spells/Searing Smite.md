The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during the spell's duration, your weapon flares with white-hot intensity, and the attack deals an extra **1d6** fire damage to the target and causes the target to ignite in flames. At the start of each of its turns until the spell ends, the target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes **1d6** fire damage. On a successful save, the spell ends. If the target or a creature within 5 feet of it uses an action to put out the flames, or if some other effect douses the flames (such as the target being submerged in water), the spell ends.


**_At Higher Levels_**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial extra damage dealt by the attack increases by **1d6** for each slot level above 1st.
