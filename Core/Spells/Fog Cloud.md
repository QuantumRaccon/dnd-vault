_1st-level Conjuration_
**Casting Time**:: 1 action
**Range**:: 120 feet
**Components**:: V, S
**Duration**:: Concentration, 1 hour

You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.


**_At Higher Levels_**. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above 1st.
