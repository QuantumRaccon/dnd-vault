You magically empower your movement with dance-like steps, giving yourself the following benefits for the duration.


- Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.
- You don't provoke opportunity attacks.
- You can move through the space of another creature, and it doesn't count as [[difficult terrain]]. If you end your turn in another creature's space, you are shunted to the last unoccupied space you occupied, and you take **1d8** force damage.
