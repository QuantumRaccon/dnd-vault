The bones of the dead are warded to eliminate any thieves.

**Effect.** The doors slam shut and lock as a poisonous cloud (treat as a DC 15 [[Cloudkill]] spell) fills the room.

**Countermeasures.** A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check notes arcane runes on the back of the doors and in the burial niches. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) check realizes that they are tied to a conjuration ward. The runes can be destroyed with dispel magic (DC 15 or cast at 5th level), which disperses the cloud.
