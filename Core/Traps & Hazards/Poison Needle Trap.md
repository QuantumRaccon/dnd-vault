A tiny, poisoned needle hidden in a lock is a good way to discourage thieves from plundering a hoard. Such a trap is usually put in a chest or in the door to a treasure chamber.

**Effect.** The triggering creature must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 14 (**4d6**) poison damage and is [[poisoned]] for 10 minutes. While [[poisoned]] in this way, the creature is [[paralyzed]]. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[poisoned]].

**Countermeasures.** A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the needle, but only if a character inspects the lock. A successful DC 20 Dexterity check using [[thieves' tools]] disables the needle, and a check with a total of 10 or lower triggers the trap.
