The court jester devised a deadly trap to foil anyone who sought to steal his magic fool's cap. The jester's tomb is located at the end of a 10-foot-wide, 150-foot-long hallway that descends sharply from north to south. The entrance to the tomb is a door on the eastern wall at the bottom of the slope, at the south end of the hall.

**Active Elements.** Although the trap is complex in nature, it has a single active element. That's all it needs.

- **Sphere of Crushing Doom (Initiative 10)**: The trap's active element is a sphere of steel that almost fills the 10-foot width of the hallway and rolls to the bottom of the slope on its turn. Each creature in the sphere's path must make a DC 20 Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 22 (**4d10**) bludgeoning damage and is knocked [[prone]]. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't knocked [[prone]]. Objects that block the sphere, such as a conjured wall, take maximum damage from the impact.

**Dynamic Elements.** The longer it rolls, the more lethal the sphere becomes.

- **Speed Kills**: After its turn, the sphere gains speed, represented by its damage increasing by 11 (**2d10**). While its damage is 55 (**10d10**) or greater, it acts on initiative count 20 and 10.

**Countermeasures.** The trap can be neutralized either by stopping the sphere or preventing it from teleporting.

- **Stop the Sphere**: Stopping the sphere is the easiest way to disrupt the trap. A wall of force can do so easily, as can any object placed in its path that has enough hit points to absorb damage from the sphere without being destroyed.
- **Disrupt the Portals**: Either portal can be neutralized with three successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) checks, but the process of analyzing a portal to disrupt it takes time. Faint runes in the ceiling and floor at both ends of the hallway are involved in the functioning of the portals. A creature must first use an action to examine a set of runes, then use a subsequent action to attempt to vandalize the runes. Each successful check reduces the sphere's damage by 11 (**2d10**), as the disrupted sphere loses speed moving through the failing portal.
Alternatively, a set of runes can be disabled with three successful castings of [[Dispel Magic]] (DC 19) targeting any of the runes in the set.
If the southern portal is destroyed, the sphere slams into the south wall and comes to a halt. It blocks the door to the tomb, but the characters can escape.
