The crossbow trap is a favorite of kobolds and other creatures that rely on traps to defend their lairs. It consists of a trip wire strung across a hallway and connected to a pair of hidden heavy crossbows. The crossbows are aimed to fire down the hallway at anyone who disturbs the trip wire.

**Effect.** The trap makes two attacks against the triggering creature.  **8** to hit, two attacks; Hit: 5 (**1d10**) piercing damage on a hit. This attack can't gain advantage or disadvantage.

**Countermeasures.** A successful DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the trip wire. A successful DC 15 Dexterity check using [[thieves' tools]] disables the trip wire, and a check with a total of 5 or lower triggers the trap.
