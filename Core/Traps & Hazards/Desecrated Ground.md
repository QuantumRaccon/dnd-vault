Some cemeteries and catacombs are imbued with the unseen traces of ancient evil. An area of desecrated ground can be any size, and a [[Detect Evil and Good]] spell cast within range reveals its presence.

Undead standing on desecrated ground have advantage on all saving throws.

A vial of [[holy water (flask) \|holy water]] purifies a 10-foot-square area of desecrated ground when sprinkled on it, and a [[Hallow]] spell purifies desecrated ground within its area.
