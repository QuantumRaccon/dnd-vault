Supernaturally powerful winds—like those from planes such as Pandemonium or Minethys, the third layer of Carceri—can spawn flaywinds. A flaywind is an intense sandstorm, gathering large rocks and other debris in addition to sand or grit. The area within the storm is heavily obscured, and a creature exposed to the storm takes **1d4** slashing damage at the start of each of its turns. Only substantial cover or shelter offers protection against the flensing grit.

A flaywind leaves **4d6** feet of sand or debris in its wake. A successful DC 15 Intelligence (Arcana) or (Nature) check or Wisdom (Survival) check allows a character to recognize a flaywind 1 minute before it strikes, allowing time to seek shelter. A flaywind typically lasts **1d4 × 10** hours.
