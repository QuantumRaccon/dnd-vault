The malfunctioning Phase Transference Emitter consists of two primary components. The power battery is a 10-foot circular matrix of conduction coils wired directly to a generator via a secure power cable. The coils have ten nodes that connect to a large eight-foot tall cylindrical steel emitter rigged on a swivel.

**Active Elements.** The Phase Transference Emitter is overloading. Both the emitter's ray and the coil matrix are dangerous. The emitter's housing is extremely hot from the massive influx of electricity.

- **Phase Beam (Initiative 20)**: The phase beam shoots at a random creature within the room. The beam has a **+5** bonus to the attack roll. On a hit, the target and all its gear become both [[invisible]] and incorporeal for one minute. The target's only method of movement is a fly speed of 10 feet. The target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through solid surfaces and liquids. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air even when [[stunned]] or otherwise [[incapacitated]]. While affected by the phase beam, the target can't manipulate, physically attack, or interact with objects and creatures not affected by the phase beam. The target can still talk and cast spells.
- **Coil Discharge (Initiative 10)**: Arc bolts of electricity flash out of the matrix. Each creature within 30 feet of the power matrix must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 10 (**3d6**) lightning damage.

**Dynamic Elements.** As time passes, the device becomes more erratic and eventually explodes.

- **Phase Beam Fires More Often**: Starting on its fourth turn, the phase beam attacks on initiative 10 as well as initiative 20.
- **Room Heats Up**: The heat from the emitter brings the room to unbearable temperatures. At the beginning of the trap's third turn, the room's temperature is noticeably hotter. At the beginning of the trap's sixth turn on initiative 20, all creatures must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or gain one level of [[exhaustion]]. Creatures wearing medium or heavy armor have disadvantage on the saving throw, and creatures with fire immunity or resistance do not need to make this saving throw. This saving throw is repeated at DC 13 at the beginning of the trap's ninth turn on initiative 20.
- **Explosion**: At the beginning of the trap's tenth turn, the entire system overloads and the power matrix explodes, dealing 35 (**10d6**) fire damage to everyone in the room, shorting out the power for the whole facility, and causing an Azorius response team to be sent out to find out what happened. The trap is destroyed, along with Delrim's prospects of ever graduating from Prism University.

**Constant Elements.** The emitter and power coil matrix are both dangerous to be near.

- **Coil Discharge**: Any creature that ends its turn within 5 feet of the power matrix must make a DC 11 Dexterity saving throw or take 7 (**2d6**) lightning damage. Creatures wearing metal armor have disadvantage on the saving throw.
- **Emitter Heat**: The emitter is hot to the touch. Any creature touching the emitter takes 3 (**1d6**) fire damage.

**Countermeasures.** There are ways to thwart the trap's active elements and prevent the explosion from occurring.

- **Phase Beam**: Characters can anticipate the beam's firing sequence, lock the swivel, or sever the power cables connecting the emitter to the power matrix.
   - Intelligence (Investigation), DC 15: As an action, a creature that can see the emitter can attempt an Intelligence (Investigation) check. A successful check means that the creature now can anticipate the emitter's firing sequence. Phase beam attacks that target that creature have disadvantage.
   - Dexterity check using thieves' tools or Strength check, DC 15: Creatures can attempt to lock the swivel on the emitter to keep the beam pointed at only one spot, thus making the beam easily avoidable. A successful check means the phase beam attack is considered disabled. Creatures that attempt this must touch the emitter, taking the emitter heat damage.
   - Attack: As an action, a creature can sever one of the ten power cables connected to the emitter. Each power cable has AC 5 and 3 hit points. For every two power cables severed (round down), the phase beam attack bonus is reduced by 1. Once the tenth power cable is severed, the emitter ceases to function and the phase beam attack as well as the emitter heat constant element are disabled.
- **Coil Discharge**: The coils can be shut down by dispelling or disabling the magic that amplifies their energy or by shutting off the power source.
   - Intelligence (Arcana), DC 15: The magic augmenting the power matrix can be disabled with three successful checks. Alternatively, it can be disabled with one successful casting of [[Dispel Magic]] (DC 13) targeting the coils. If the coils are disabled, it disables the coil discharge elements as well as the explosion dynamic element. The emitter is still active, receiving some power from the matrix. Creatures that attempt this are subject to the coil discharge constant element if they end their turn next to the power matrix.
   - Shut off the main power cable: On the wall near the power matrix is a mizzium-reinforced metal casing that holds the main power breaker for the matrix. It can be spotted with a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check if someone is looking for something else notable in the lab. This is securely locked, requiring two successful DC 20 Dexterity checks with [[thieves' tools]], two successful DC 16 Intelligence (Arcana) checks, or 20 points of damage with a magic weapon to break open. Once opened, a switch can be thrown to shut down the matrix, disabling all elements of the trap.
