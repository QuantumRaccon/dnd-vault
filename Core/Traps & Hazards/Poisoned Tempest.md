This fiendish trap was built to eliminate intruders who infiltrate a yuan-ti temple. The trap is a room, 60 feet on a side, with 5-foot-wide stone doors in the middle of each wall. In each corner of the room stands a 10-foot-tall statue of a great serpent, coiled and ready to strike. The eyes in each statue are rubies worth 200 gp apiece.

**Active Elements.** The trap fills the room with poison and other deadly effects.

- **Locked Doors (Initiative 20)**: The four doors to this room slam shut and are locked in place by magic. This effect activates only once, the first time the trap is triggered.
- **Poison Gas (Initiative 20)**: Poison gas floods the room. Each creature inside must make a DC 20 Constitution saving throw, taking 33 (**6d10**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
- **Tempest (Initiative 10)**: Air and gas boils from the trap. Roll a d6, and consult the following table.
### Tempest Effects
---
|d6|Effect|
|---|-----------|
|1|Hallucinatory gas scrambles the mind and senses. All Intelligence and Wisdom checks made in the room have disadvantage until the Tempest element activates again.|
|2|Explosive gas fills the area. If anyone holds an open flame, it causes an explosion. All creatures in the area must make a DC 20 Dexterity saving throw, taking 22 (**4d10**) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The flame is then extinguished.|
|3|Weakening gas fills the room. All Strength and Dexterity checks made in the room have disadvantage until the Tempest element activates again.|
|4|Buffeting winds force each creature in the room to succeed on a DC 20 Strength saving throw or be knocked [[prone]].|
|5|Smoke fills the room. Visibility is reduced to 1 foot until the next time the Tempest element activates.|
|6|Poison floods the room, forcing creatures to make saving throws as for the Poison Gas element.|


**Dynamic Elements.** The longer the poison gas remains in the room, the more lethal it becomes.

- **Increased Potency**: The damage from the Poison Gas element increases by 11 (**2d10**) each round after it activates, to a maximum of 55 (**10d10**).

**Countermeasures.** There are a few ways that the trap can be overcome.

- **Open the Doors**: Opening the doors is the quickest way to circumvent the trap, but they are warded with magic. To open the doors, a character must first succeed on a DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check to find the locking mechanism. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check is then required to disable the sphere of force that surrounds the lock ([[Dispel Magic]] is ineffective against it). Success on a DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools picks the lock. Finally, a successful DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check is needed to push the door open. Each check requires an action.
- **Disable the Statues**: A statue can be disabled by blocking the flow of gas from its mouth. Heavily damaging a statue is a bad idea, for doing so leaves the gas vents open. Reducing a statue to 0 hit points (AC 17; 20 hp; resistance to fire, piercing, and slashing damage; immune to poison and psychic damage) or making a successful DC 20 Strength check to break it cracks the statue and increases the Poison Gas damage by 5 (**1d10**). A successful DC 20 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, or a successful DC 15 Strength check made to block up the statue with a cloak or similar object, decreases the poison damage by 5 (**1d10**). Once a character succeeds on the check, someone must remain next to the statue to keep it blocked up. When all four statues are blocked in this manner, the trap deactivates.
