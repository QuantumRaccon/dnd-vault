In some cases you need to determine damage on the fly. The Improvising Damage table gives you suggestions for when you do so.

### Improvising Damage
---
|Dice|Examples|
|---|-----------|
|**1d10**|Burned by coals, hit by a falling bookcase, pricked by a poison needle|
|**2d10**|Being struck by lightning, stumbling into a fire pit|
|**4d10**|Hit by falling rubble in a collapsing tunnel, stumbling into a vat of acid|
|**10d10**|Crushed by compacting walls, hit by whirling steel blades, wading through a lava stream|
|**18d10**|Being submerged in lava, being hit by a crashing flying fortress|
|**24d10**|Tumbling into a vortex of fire on the Elemental Plane of Fire, being crushed in the jaws of a godlike creature or a moon-sized monster|

The Damage Severity and Level table is a guide to how deadly these damage numbers are for characters of various levels. Cross-reference a character's level with the damage being dealt to gauge the severity of the damage.

### Damage Severity and Level
---
|Character Level|Setback|Dangerous|Deadly|
|----|----|----|----|
|1st-4th|**1d10**|**2d10**|**4d10**|
|5th-10th|**2d10**|**4d10**|**10d10**|
|11th-16th|**4d10**|**10d10**|**18d10**|
|17th-20th|**10d10**|**18d10**|**24d10**|

Damage sufficient to cause a  rarely poses a risk of death to characters of the level shown, but a severely weakened character might be laid low by this damage.

In contrast,  damage values pose a significant threat to weaker characters and could potentially kill a character of the level shown if that character is missing many hit points.

As the name suggests,  damage is enough to drop a character of the level shown to 0 hit points. This level of damage can kill even powerful characters outright if they are already wounded.
