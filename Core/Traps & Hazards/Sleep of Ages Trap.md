When a sleep of ages trap activates, a pressure plate unleashes a spell that threatens to send intruders into a deep slumber. The dungeon's guardians can then more easily dispose of the sleepers.

**Effect.** When activated, this trap casts a [[Sleep]] spell centered on the pressure plate, using a 9th-level spell slot.

**Countermeasures.** A successful DC 20 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the pressure plate. A successful DC 20 Intelligence (Arcana) check made within 5 feet of the pressure plate disables the trap, and a check with a total of 10 or lower triggers it. A successful [[Dispel Magic]] (DC 19) cast on the pressure plate destroys the trap.
