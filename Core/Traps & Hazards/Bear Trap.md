A bear trap resembles a set of iron jaws that springs shut when stepped on, clamping down on a creature's leg. The trap is spiked in the ground, leaving the victim immobilized.

**Effect.**  **8** to hit, triggering creature. Hit: 5 (**1d10**) piercing damage. This attack can't gain advantage or disadvantage. A creature hit by the trap has its speed reduced to 0. It can't move until it breaks free of the trap, which requires a successful DC 15 Strength check by the creature or another creature adjacent to the trap.

**Countermeasures.** A successful DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check reveals the trap. A successful DC 10 Dexterity check using [[thieves' tools]] disables it.
