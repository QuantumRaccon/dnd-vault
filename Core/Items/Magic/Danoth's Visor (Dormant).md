These mithral-frame goggles with clear diamond lenses were used by the evoker Danoth Oro to spot [[invisible]] enemies and scout areas from afar.

**_Dormant_**. While wearing the goggles in their dormant state, you can see normally in darkness, both magical and nonmagical, to a distance of 60 feet. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Investigation) and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight.
