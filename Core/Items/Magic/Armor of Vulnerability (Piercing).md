**AC: 18**

While wearing this armor, you have resistance to piercing damage.

**_Curse_**. This armor is cursed, a fact that is revealed only when an [[identify]] spell is cast on the armor or you attune to it. Attuning to the armor curses you until you are targeted by the [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic; removing the armor fails to end the curse. While cursed you have vulnerability to bludgeoning and slashing damage.
