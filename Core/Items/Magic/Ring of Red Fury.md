This ring has a stripe of ruidium running through it. While wearing the ring, you gain the following benefits:

- You can breathe water.
- You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

**_Ruidium Rage_**. As a bonus action, you can use the ring to gain the following benefits, which last for 1 minute or until you are [[incapacitated]]:

- You have advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws.
- When you hit with an attack, you can add your proficiency bonus to the damage roll.
- Difficult terrain doesn't cost you extra movement, and you are immune to the [[paralyzed]] and [[restrained]] conditions.

You can't use this property of the ring again until you finish a long rest.

**_Ruidium Corruption_**. When you use the Ruidium Rage property of the ring, you must make a DC 20 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

**_If Ruidium Is Destroyed_**. If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and the ring of red fury becomes a [[ring of free action]].
