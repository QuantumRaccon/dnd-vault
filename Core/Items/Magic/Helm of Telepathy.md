While wearing this helm, you can use an action to cast the [[detect thoughts]] spell (save DC 13) from it. As long as you maintain concentration on the spell, you can use a bonus action to send a telepathic message to a creature you are focused on. It can reply—using a bonus action to do so—while your focus on it continues.

While focusing on a creature with [[detect thoughts]], you can use an action to cast the [[suggestion]] spell (save DC 13) from the helm on that creature. Once used, the suggestion property can't be used again until the next dawn.
