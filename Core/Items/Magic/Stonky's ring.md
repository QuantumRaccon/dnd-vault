While wearing this ring, you can cast the [[telekinesis]] spell at will, but you can target only objects that aren't being worn or carried.

Any character who attunes to the ring gains control of Stonky's creations, though the [[Skitterwidget \|skitterwidgets]] ignore commands spoken more than 30 feet away from them.
