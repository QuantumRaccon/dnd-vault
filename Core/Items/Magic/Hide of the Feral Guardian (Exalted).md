**AC: 12 + Dex**

It is believed that this polished and beautifully detailed leather armor was a gift from Melora, bestowed on a long-forgotten archdruid and champion of the natural world before the terrors of the Calamity.

**_Dormant_**. While wearing the armor in its dormant state, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor grants you a +1 bonus to AC.
- While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, you have a +1 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls, and you retain the benefits of this armor.
- As an action, you can use the armor to cast [[polymorph]] on yourself, transforming into a [[Core/Monsters/Giant Owl]] while retaining your Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.

**_Awakened_**. When the armor reaches an awakened state, it gains the following properties:

- The AC bonus of the armor increases to +2.
- While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, your bonus to melee attack and damage rolls increases by 1 (to +2).

- The AC bonus of the armor increases to +3.
- While you are transformed by an effect that replaces any of your game statistics with those of another creature, your bonus to melee attack and damage rolls increases by 1 (to +3).
