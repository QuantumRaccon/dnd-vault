**1d12, slashing - heavy, two-handed**

A mighty axe wielded long ago by the dwarf king Torhild Flametongue, Orcsplitter is a battered weapon that appears unremarkable at first glance. Its head is graven with the Dwarvish runes for "orc," but the runes are depicted with a gap or slash through the markings; the word "orc" is literally split in two.

You gain the following benefits while holding this magic weapon:

- You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.
- When you roll a 20 on an attack roll with this weapon against an [[Core/Monsters/Orc]], that [[Core/Monsters/Orc]] must succeed on a DC 17 Constitution saving throw or drop to 0 hit points.
- You can't be surprised by [[Core/Monsters/Orc]] while you're not [[incapacitated]]. You are also aware when [[Core/Monsters/Orc]] are within 120 feet of you and aren't behind total cover, although you don't know their location.
- You and any of your friends within 30 feet of you can't be [[frightened]] while you're not [[incapacitated]].

**_Sentience_**. Orcsplitter is a sentient, lawful good weapon with an Intelligence of 6, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 10. It can see and hear out to 120 feet and has [[darkvision]]. It communicates by transmitting emotions to its wielder, although on rare occasions it uses a limited form of telepathy to bring to the wielder's mind a couplet or stanza of ancient Dwarvish verse.

**_Personality_**. Orcsplitter is grim, taciturn, and inflexible. It knows little more than the desire to face [[Core/Monsters/Orc]] in battle and serve a courageous, just wielder. It disdains cowards and any form of duplicity, deception, or disloyalty. The weapon's purpose is to defend dwarves and to serve as a symbol of dwarven resolve. It hates the traditional foes of dwarves—giants, goblins, and, most of all, [[Core/Monsters/Orc]]—and silently urges its possessor to meet such creatures in battle.
