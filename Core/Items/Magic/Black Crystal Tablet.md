Any creature that attunes to the tablet must make a DC 20 Wisdom saving throw at the end of its next long rest. On a failed save, the creature becomes afflicted with a random form of long-term madness (see "[[Madness \|8]]" in chapter 8 of the [[Dungeon Master's Guide]]).

As an action, a creature attuned to the Black Crystal Tablet can use it to cast [[eyebite]] or [[gate]] (the portal created by this spell links to the Far Realm only). After the tablet is used to cast a spell, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.
