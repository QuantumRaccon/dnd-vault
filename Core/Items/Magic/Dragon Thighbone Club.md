**1d8, bludgeoning - two-handed**

This red dragon's thighbone is 14 feet long, 250 lbs, and is wrapped in old leather, suggesting that it was once used as a giant's greatclub.

When you hit a creature of the dragon type with this weapon, it deals an extra **2d8** bludgeoning damage.

If you attune to the greatclub, it magically shrinks to a size that you can wield effectively.
