**1d6, bludgeoning - versatile (1d8)**

You have resistance to cold damage while you hold this staff.

The staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[cone of cold]] (5 charges), [[fog cloud]] (1 charge), [[ice storm]] (4 charges), or [[wall of ice]] (4 charges).

The staff regains **1d6 + 4** expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a **d20**. On a 1. the staff turns to water and is destroyed.
