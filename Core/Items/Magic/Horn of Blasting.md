You can use an action to speak the horn's command word and then blow the horn, which emits a thunderous blast in a 30-foot cone that is audible 600 feet away. Each creature in the cone must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes **5d6** thunder damage and is [[deafened]] for 1 minute. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage and isn't [[deafened]]. Creatures and objects made of glass or crystal have disadvantage on the saving throw and take **10d6** thunder damage instead of **5d6**.

Each use of the horn's magic has a 20 percent chance of causing the horn to explode. The explosion deals **10d6** fire damage to the blower and destroys the horn.
