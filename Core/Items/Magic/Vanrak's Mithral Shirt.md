**AC: 13 + Dex (max: 2)**

Mithral is a light, flexible metal. A mithral chain shirt or breastplate can be worn under normal clothes. If the armor normally imposes disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks or has a Strength requirement, the mithral version of the armor doesn't.

While you wear this armor, you gain [[darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet.
