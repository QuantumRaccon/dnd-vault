This [[crystal ball]] is about 6 inches in diameter. While touching it, you can cast the [[scrying]] spell (save DC 17) with it.

While [[scrying]] with the [[crystal ball]], you can communicate telepathically with creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You can also use an action to cast the [[suggestion]] spell (save DC 17) through the sensor on one of those creatures. You don't need to concentrate on this suggestion to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if [[scrying]] ends. Once used, the suggestion power of the [[crystal ball]] can't be used again until the next dawn.
