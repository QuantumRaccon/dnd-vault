**Inherits**. When you attack a creature with this magic weapon and roll a 20 on the attack roll, that target takes an extra 10 necrotic damage if it isn't a construct or an undead. You also gain 10 temporary hit points.

_Note: According to the SRD, it is an extra **3d6** necrotic damage, although [this is incorrect](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/a/174522/53884)._
