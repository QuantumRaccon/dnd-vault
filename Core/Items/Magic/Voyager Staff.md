**1d6, bludgeoning - versatile (1d8)**

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic quarterstaff. While you hold it, you gain a +1 bonus to spell attack rolls.

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of the staff's charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC: [[banishment]] (4 charges), [[blink]] (3 charges), [[misty step]] (2 charges), [[passwall]] (5 charges), or [[teleport]] (7 charges).

The staff regains **1d6 + 4** expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a **d20**. On a 1, the staff vanishes forever.
