The rod has 5 charges. While you hold it, you can use an action to cast one of the following spells from it: [[heal]] (expends 1 charge) or [[resurrection]] (expends 5 charges).

The rod regains 1 expended charge daily at dawn. If the rod is reduced to 0 charges, roll a **d20**. On a 1, the rod disappears in a burst of radiance.
