This wand has 7 charges for the following properties. It regains **1d6 + 1** expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the wand's last charge, roll a **d20**. On a 1, the wand crumbles into ashes and is destroyed.

**_Spells_**. While holding the wand, you can use an action to expend some of its charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 17): [[hold monster]] (5 charges) or [[hold person]] (2 charges).

**_Assisted Escape_**. While holding the wand, you can use your reaction to expend 1 charge and gain advantage on a saving throw you make to avoid being [[paralyzed]] or [[restrained]], or you can expend 1 charge and gain advantage on any check you make to escape a grapple.
