This scarf is made of sturdy cloth and covered in platinum-colored scales.

As an action, you can pull a scale from the scarf and speak a command word. When you do so, choose one of the following effects:

**_Breath of Life_**. The scale disappears, and you or a creature you touch regains **10d4** hit points.

**_Platinum Shield_**. For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a [[+1 shield]], which you or another creature can use. A creature wielding the shield has immunity to radiant damage.

**_Radiant Hammer_**. For 1 hour or until you dismiss it (no action required), the scale becomes a magic [[light hammer]], which you or another creature can use. The weapon deals **2d4** radiant damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for a light hammer. It deals an extra **2d4** radiant damage to chromatic dragons.

Once three scales have been pulled from the scarf, no more scales can be removed until the next dawn, when all the missing scales grow back. If you pull off a scale but don't speak a command word, it disappears after 1 minute.
