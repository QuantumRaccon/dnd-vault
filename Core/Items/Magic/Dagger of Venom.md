**1d4, piercing - finesse, light, thrown (20/60 ft.)**

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.

You can use an action to cause thick, black poison to coat the blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take **2d10** poison damage and become [[poisoned]] for 1 minute. The dagger can't be used this way again until the next dawn.
