**1d6, piercing - finesse, thrown (20/60 ft.), versatile (1d8)**

A silver spear, Windvane has dark sapphires on the filigreed surface of its polished head. Held by its shining haft, the weapon feels insubstantial, as if clutching a cool, gently flowing breeze. The spear contains a spark of [[Yan-C-Bin]], the Prince of Evil Air.

You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon, which has the finesse weapon property. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra **1d6** lightning damage.

**_Air Mastery_**. You gain the following benefits while you hold Windvane:

- You can speak Auran fluently.
- You have resistance to lightning damage.
- You can cast [[dominate monster]] (save DC 17) on an [[Air Elemental]]. Once you have done so, Windvane can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

**_Song of the Four Winds_**. While inside an air node, you can perform a ritual called the Song of the Four Winds, using Windvane to create a [[devastation orb of air]]. Once you perform the ritual, Windvane can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

**_Flaw_**. Windvane makes its wielder mercurial and unreliable. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I break my vows and plans. Duty and honor mean nothing to me."
