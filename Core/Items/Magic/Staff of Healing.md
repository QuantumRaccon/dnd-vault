**1d6, bludgeoning - versatile (1d8)**

This staff has 10 charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its charges to cast one of the following spells from it, using your spell save DC and spellcasting ability modifier: [[cure wounds]] (1 charge per spell level, up to 4th), [[lesser restoration]] (2 charges). or [[mass cure wounds]] (5 charges).

The staff regains **1d6 + 4** expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a **d20**. On a 1. the staff vanishes in a flash of light, lost forever.
