**1d4, piercing - finesse, light, thrown (20/60 ft.)**

You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. Its blade is cruelly serrated, and its hilt resembles a demonic head and wings. Whenever you slay a creature with an attack using the dagger, the creature's soul is imprisoned inside the dagger, and that creature can be restored to life only by a [[wish]] spell. The dagger can hold a maximum of five souls.

For each soul imprisoned in the dagger, your attacks with it deal an extra **1d4** necrotic damage on a hit. While the dagger is within 5 feet of you, your dreams are haunted by whispers from the trapped souls.

The dagger has the following additional properties.

**_Siphon Vitality_**. As a bonus action, you can release any number of stored souls from the dagger to regain **1d10** hit points per soul released.

**_Annihilation_**. If the dagger holds five souls, you can use this property: As a reaction immediately after you hit a creature with the dagger and deal damage to that target, you can release all five souls. If the target now has fewer than 75 hit points, it must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or die. If the target dies, you can't use this property again until you finish a long rest.
