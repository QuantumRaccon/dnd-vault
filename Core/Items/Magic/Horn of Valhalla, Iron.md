You can use an action to blow this horn. In response, warrior spirits from the plane of Ysgard appear within 60 feet of you. These spirits use the [[Berserker]] statistics. They return to Ysgard after 1 hour or when they drop to 0 hit points. Once you use the horn, it can't be used again until 7 days have passed.

The iron horn summons **5d4 + 5** [[Berserker]]. To use the iron horn, you must be proficient with all martial weapons.

If you blow the horn without meeting its requirement, the summoned [[Berserker]] attack you. If you meet the requirement, they are friendly to you and your companions and follow your commands.
