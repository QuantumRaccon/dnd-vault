This painted brass bottle weighs 1 pound. When you use an action to remove the stopper, a cloud of thick smoke flows out of the bottle. At the end of your turn, the smoke disappears with a flash of harmless fire, and an [[Efreeti]] appears in an unoccupied space within 30 feet of you.

The first time the bottle is opened, the DM rolls to determine what happens.

|**d100**|Effect|
|--|------------|
|01-10|The [[Efreeti]] attacks you. After fighting for 5 rounds, the [[Efreeti]] disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.|
|11-90|The [[Efreeti]] serves you for 1 hour, doing as you command. Then the [[Efreeti]] returns to the bottle, and a new stopper contains it. The stopper can't be removed for 24 hours. The next two times the bottle is opened, the same effect occurs. If the bottle is opened a fourth time, the [[Efreeti]] escapes and disappears, and the bottle loses its magic.|
|91-00|The [[Efreeti]] can cast the [[wish]] spell three times for you. It disappears when it grants the final wish or after 1 hour, and the bottle loses its magic.|
