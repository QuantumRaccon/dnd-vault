**AC: 18**

This suit of plate armor is fashioned from [[Giant Scorpion]] chitin. While wearing this armor, you gain the following benefits:

- The armor improves your combat readiness, granting you a +5 bonus to initiative as long as you aren't [[incapacitated]].
- The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on your Dexterity (Stealth) checks.
- The armor doesn't impose disadvantage on saving throws made to resist the effects of extreme heat (see chapter 5 of the Dungeon Master's Guide).

**_Curse_**. This armor is cursed. Whenever you don or doff it, you must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw, taking 100 (**10d10 + 45**) poison damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Only a [[wish]] spell can remove the armor's curse.
