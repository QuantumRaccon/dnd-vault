**1d4, piercing - finesse, light, thrown (20/60 ft.)**

A flint dagger, Tinderstrike is uncommonly sharp, and sparks cascade off its edge whenever it strikes something solid. Its handle is always warm to the touch, and the blade smolders for **1d4** minutes after it is used to deal damage. It contains a spark of [[Imix]], Prince of Evil Fire.

You gain a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with it, the target takes an extra **2d6** fire damage.

**_Fire Mastery_**. You gain the following benefits while you hold Tinderstrike:

- You can speak Ignan fluently.
- You have resistance to fire damage.
- You can cast [[dominate monster]] (save DC 17) on a [[Fire Elemental]]. Once you have done so, Tinderstrike can't be used this way again until the next dawn.

**_Dance of the All-Consuming Fire_**. While inside a fire node, you can perform a ritual called the Dance of the All-Consuming Fire, using Tinderstrike to create a [[devastation orb of fire]]. Once you perform the ritual, Tinderstrike can't be used to perform the ritual again until the next dawn.

**_Flaw_**. Tinderstrike makes its wielder impatient and rash. While attuned to the weapon, you gain the following flaw: "I act without thinking and take risks without weighing the consequences."
