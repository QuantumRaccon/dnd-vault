This mithral skeleton key was forged using the blood of twelve master thieves executed for trying to steal magic items during the Age of Arcanum.

**_Dormant_**. The Infiltrator's Key grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- The key can be used as [[thieves' tools]] for the purpose of opening locks. When using the key, you are considered proficient in [[thieves' tools]] and you have advantage on ability checks made to open locks.
- While holding the key, your steps are muffled, giving you advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks made to move silently.
