**1d4, piercing - finesse, light, thrown (20/60 ft.)**

A creature that wields the [[Naizu-Ha]] while it is in this form gains a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls with the dagger, and attacks with the dagger score a critical hit on a roll of 19 or 20. In addition, the wielder can't take the [[Disengage]] action unless it succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw.
