Also at rank 1, you are the beneficiary of a whisper jar—a common magic item resembling an ether-filled jar with a long tap hose. The jar is used to record others' stories and your own observations, like a verbal notebook with unlimited space. The whisper jar records as fast as a creature can speak into it, and whispers back words at the same pace they were recorded. Activating the playback of a particular recording is an action.

### Things Recorded in Your Whisper Jar
---
|d8|Recording|
|---|-----------|
|1|A live recording of the only performance of the mostly forgotten stage play Tabaxi on a Hot Tin Roof|
|2|The life's work of the loremonger who owned the jar before you|
|3|Every courageous thought you've ever had, to cover for how scared you are most of the time|
|4|Everything, because everyone else around you will eat their words one day!|
|5|The top seven places to eat fried rat skewers in every settlement you've ever visited|
|6|The entire family tree of every royal line, extant or lost, in Faerûn|
|7|A moment-by-moment review of your favorite Jim Darkmagic stage performance|
|8|The sound of raucous applause, which you play back liberally|

**_Whispered Encyclopedia_**. At rank 2, your whisper jar becomes an uncommon magic item that can tap into the broader lore of Acquisitions Incorporated. As a bonus action, you ask the jar for information on a specific subject and make a DC 15 Intelligence (History) check. On a success, the jar plays back a recording on that subject, made somewhere, sometime by another Acq Inc loremonger. This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.

**_Whispered Warnings_**. Also at rank 3, your whisper jar gains additional power and becomes a rare magic item. As an action, you can cause the jar to function as a [[wand of enemy detection]], whereupon it whispers the direction to foes within range. This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.

**_Whispered Arcana_**. Also at rank 4, your whisper jar gains access to even more magic. By whispering the name of one of the following spells into the jar as an action, you can cast that spell from the jar: [[detect evil and good]], [[detect magic]], [[detect poison and disease]], [[find traps]], [[identify]], or [[locate animals or plants]]. This property of the whisper jar can't be used again until the next dawn.
