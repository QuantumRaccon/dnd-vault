This shimmering cloak is made from the scales of a [[Scitalis]]. While in an area of bright or dim light, you can pull the cloak's hood over your head to cause the scales to glimmer and shine. Each creature within 10 feet of you must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the end of its next turn. Once this property has been used twice, it can't be used again until the next dawn. Pulling the hood up or down requires an action.
