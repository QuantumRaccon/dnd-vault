Each of the quiver's three compartments connects to an extradimensional space that allows the quiver to hold numerous items while never weighing more than 2 pounds. The shortest compartment can hold up to sixty [[arrow \|arrows]], [[crossbow bolt \|bolts]], or similar objects. The midsize compartment holds up to eighteen [[javelin \|javelins]] or similar objects. The longest compartment holds up to six long objects, such as bows, [[quarterstaff \|quarterstaffs]], or [[spear \|spears]].

You can draw any item the quiver contains as if doing so from a regular quiver or scabbard.
