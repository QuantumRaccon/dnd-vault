This glass jar, 3 inches in diameter, contains **1d4 + 1** doses of a thick mixture that smells faintly of aloe. The jar and its contents weigh Â½ pound.

As an action, one dose of the ointment can be swallowed or applied to the skin. The creature that receives it regains **2d8 + 2** hit points, ceases to be [[poisoned]], and is cured of any disease.
