**1d8, piercing - finesse**

The blade of this rapier is made of spider silk. Its onyx pommel is tipped with a ruby cut in the shape of a spider, and the blade carries the blessing of Lolth.

**_Sentience_**. Silken Spite is a sentient chaotic evil weapon with an Intelligence of 13, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 15. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, Elvish, and Undercommon.

**_Personality_**. A murderous [[Yochlol]] named Sinnafex lives within Silken Spite. The weapon speaks in whispers, pushing its wielder to trust no one and to kill those who cause the slightest personal offense.

**_Dormant_**. The rapier grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal, Elvish, and Undercommon.
- You have [[darkvision]] out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have [[darkvision]], being attuned to the rapier increases the range of your [[darkvision]] by 60 feet.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.
- You can use an action to cause poison to coat the rapier's blade. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. That creature must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or become [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [[unconscious]] while [[poisoned]] in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature uses its action to shake the creature awake.
- While carrying the rapier, you can move up, down, and across vertical surfaces and upside down along ceilings, while leaving your hands free. You have a climbing speed equal to your walking speed. Additionally, you can't be caught in webs of any sort and can move through webs as if they were [[difficult terrain]].


> [!INFO] Betrayer Artifact Properties
>The Arms of the Betrayers advance in power in the same manner as the Vestiges of Divergence. In its dormant state, each of these artifacts has one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties]] property and one [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties]] property. When the artifact attains an awakened state, it gains an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties]] property and an additional [[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties]] property. When the item reaches its exalted state, it gains a [[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties]] property. See "Artifact Properties" in chapter 7 of the Dungeon Master's Guide for more information.
