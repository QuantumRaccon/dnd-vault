This crystal grants you telepathy for as long as you remain attuned to it. See the [[introduction of the Monster Manual \|0]] for rules on how this telepathy works.

The crystal also glows with a purplish inner light while you are attuned to it.

The higher your intelligence, the greater the light's intensity and the greater the range of the telepathy (see the Psi Crystal Properties table).
