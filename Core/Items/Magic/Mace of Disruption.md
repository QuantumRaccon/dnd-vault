**1d6, bludgeoning**

When you hit a fiend or an undead with this magic weapon, that creature takes an extra **2d6** radiant damage. If the target has 25 hit points or fewer after taking this damage, it must succeed on a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw or be destroyed. On a successful save, the creature becomes [[frightened]] of you until the end of your next turn.

While you hold this weapon, it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet.
