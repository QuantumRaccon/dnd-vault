**1d8, bludgeoning - versatile (1d10)**

Crafted from a single piece of obsidian, this warhammer of Torog hums with magical energy and is carved with the images of faces screaming in pain.

**_Sentience_**. Grovelthrash is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 18, a Wisdom of 15, and a Charisma of 19. It has hearing and [[darkvision]] out to a range of 120 feet.

The weapon communicates telepathically with its wielder and can speak, read, and understand Abyssal, Common, and Infernal.

**_Personality_**. A covetous [[Ultroloth]] named Ciria lives within Grovelthrash. The weapon values material possessions and doling out pain. It compliments its wielder whenever they claim treasure and takes pleasure in harming others.

**_Dormant_**. The warhammer grants the following benefits in its dormant state:

- You can speak, read, and write Abyssal and Infernal.
- You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. When you hit with an attack using this warhammer, you can deal an extra **2d6** bludgeoning damage to the target. If you do, you take **1d6** psychic damage. The warhammer deals double damage to objects and structures.
- While holding this weapon, you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) checks made to discern a lie spoken in a language you understand.
