**1d6, bludgeoning - versatile (1d8)**

This staff can be wielded as a magic quarterstaff that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.

The staff has 10 charges. When you hit with a melee attack using it, you can expend up to 3 of its charges. For each charge you expend, the target takes an extra **1d6** force damage. The staff regains **1d6 + 4** expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a **d20**. On a 1, the staff becomes a nonmagical quarterstaff.
