**Inherits**. {=baseName/at} {=baseName/l} of slaying is a magic weapon meant to slay a particular kind of creature. Some are more focused than others; for example, there are both _{=baseName/l}s of dragon slaying_ and _{=baseName/l}s of blue dragon slaying_. If a creature belonging to the type, race, or group associated with {=baseName/a} {=baseName/l} of slaying takes damage from the {=baseName/l}, the creature must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking an extra **6d10** piercing damage on a failed save, or half as much extra damage on a successful one.

Once {=baseName/a} {=baseName/l} of slaying deals its extra damage to a creature, it becomes a nonmagical {=baseName/l}.


_* This generic variant has the same name and source as the item [[arrow of slaying]]_.
