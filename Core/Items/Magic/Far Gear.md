While attuned to this device, you have a +1 bonus to Charisma saving throws, and you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks.

**_Aberrant Ally_**. You can conjure an aberrant creature from the chaos of the multiverse to serve you. This functions as the [[conjure celestial]] spell (no concentration required), except the creature you summon is an aberration of challenge rating 4 or lower. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

**_Unnatural Bane_**. You can cast the [[bane]] spell (save DC 15), which affects any number of creatures within range for 1 minute. Once you use this feature of the far gear, it cannot be used again until the next dawn.

**_Part of a Whole_**. While this component is not installed in the [[Orrery of the Wanderer]], its magic might function sporadically or with unpredictable side effects, as determined by the DM.
