**Inherits**. This magic armor has a dull, rusty color or has veins of ruidium running through it. While you wear this armor, you gain the following benefits:

- You have resistance to psychic damage.
- You can breathe water.
- You gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.

**_Ruidium Corruption_**. When you roll a 1 on a saving throw while wearing this armor, you must make a DC 15 Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, you gain 1 level of [[exhaustion]]. If you are not already suffering from ruidium corruption, you become corrupted when you fail this save.

**_If Ruidium Is Destroyed_**. If the Apotheon is killed or redeemed, all the ruidium in Exandria is destroyed instantly, and ruidium armor becomes [[+1 armor]].
