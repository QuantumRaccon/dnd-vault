**Inherits**. An orb of shielding is a polished, spherical chunk of crystal or stone aligned to one of the planes of existence. If you're a spellcaster, you can use this orb as a spellcasting focus.

If you're holding the orb when you take force damage, you can use your reaction to reduce the damage by **1d4** (to a minimum of 0).
