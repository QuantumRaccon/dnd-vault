**AC +2**

While holding this shield, you have a +2 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield's normal bonus to AC.

The shield is emblazoned with a stylized silver dragon that is the emblem of the Order of the Silver Dragon (see _Curse of Strahd_, chapter 7 (CoS)). The shield whispers warnings to its bearer, granting a +2 bonus to initiative if the bearer isn't [[incapacitated]].

A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.
