**1d4, bludgeoning - range: 60/120 ft.**

This boomerang is a ranged weapon carved from [[Griffon]] bone and etched with the symbol of elemental air. When thrown, it has a range of 60/120 feet, and any creature that is proficient with the javelin is also proficient with this weapon. On a hit, the boomerang deals **1d4** bludgeoning damage and **3d4** thunder damage, and the target must succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be [[stunned]] until the end of its next turn. On a miss, the boomerang returns to the thrower's hand.

Once the boomerang deals thunder damage to a target, the weapon loses its ability to deal thunder damage and its ability to stun a target. These properties return after the boomerang spends at least 1 hour inside an elemental air node.
