While wearing this crown, a character automatically fails any Intelligence (Investigation) check made to see through an illusion. An illusion that is touched still has its true nature revealed. However, a character wearing a crown has such a strong sense that the illusion is real that they might not know which of their senses to believe.

If this crown is closely examined by a character who succeeds on a DC 20 Intelligence (Nature) or Wisdom (Perception) check, or with a [[detect magic]] spell cast using a 3rd-level or higher spell slot, the nature of its magic is discovered.
