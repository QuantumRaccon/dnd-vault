This mask of glossy azure has spikes around its edges and a ridged horn in its center. The mask reshapes to fit a wearer attuned to it. While you are wearing the mask and attuned to it, you can access the following properties.

**_Damage Absorption_**. You have resistance against lightning damage. If you already have resistance to lightning damage from another source, you instead have immunity to lightning damage. If you already have immunity to lightning damage from another source, whenever you are subjected to lightning damage, you take none of that damage and regain a number of hit points equal to half the damage dealt of that type.

**_Draconic Majesty_**. While you are wearing no armor, you can add your Charisma bonus to your Armor Class.

**_Dragon Breath_**. If you have a breath weapon that requires rest to recharge, it gains a recharge of 6.

**_Dragon Sight_**. You gain [[darkvision]] out to 60 feet, or to an additional 60 feet if you already have that sense. Once per day, you can gain [[blindsight]] out to 30 feet for 5 minutes.

**_Dragon Tongue_**. You can speak and understand Draconic. You also have advantage on any Charisma check you make against Blue Dragons.

**_Legendary Resistance_**. (1/Day) If you fail a saving throw, you can choose to succeed instead.

**_Lingering Shock_**. If you deal lightning damage to a creature, it can't take reactions until its next turn.
