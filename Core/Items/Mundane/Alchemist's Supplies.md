Alchemist's supplies enable a character to produce useful concoctions, such as acid or alchemist's fire.

**_Components_**. Alchemist's supplies include two glass beakers, a metal frame to hold a beaker in place over an open flame, a glass stirring rod, a small mortar and pestle, and a pouch of common alchemical ingredients, including salt, powdered iron, and purified water.

**_Arcana_**. Proficiency with alchemist's supplies allows you to unlock more information on Arcana checks involving potions and similar materials.

**_Investigation_**. When you inspect an area for clues, proficiency with alchemist's supplies grants additional insight into any chemicals or other substances that might have been used in the area.

**_Alchemical Crafting_**. You can use this tool proficiency to create alchemical items. A character can spend money to collect raw materials, which weigh 1 pound for every 50 gp spent. The DM can allow a character to make a check using the indicated skill with advantage. As part of a long rest, you can use alchemist's supplies to make one dose of [[acid (vial) \|acid]], [[alchemist's fire (flask) \|alchemist's fire]], [[antitoxin (vial) \|antitoxin]], [[oil (flask) \|oil]], [[perfume (vial) \|perfume]], or [[soap]]. Subtract half the value of the created item from the total gp worth of raw materials you are carrying.
