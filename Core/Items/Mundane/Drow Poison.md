This poison is typically made only by the [[Drow]], and only in a place far removed from sunlight. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 13 Constitution saving throw or be [[poisoned]] for 1 hour. If the saving throw fails by 5 or more, the creature is also [[unconscious]] while [[poisoned]] in this way. The creature wakes up if it takes damage or if another creature takes an action to shake it awake.
