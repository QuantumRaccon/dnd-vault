The adhesive material produced by a [[Resinous Frog]] remains viable for 24 hours after it is removed from the frog. A resinous frog produces one ounce of collectible resin each day or four ounces if slain. One ounce of resin can cover a 1-foot square surface and creates a bond between any two objects. A successful DC 13 Strength check breaks the bond, freeing the objects from each other.
