This poison is created from blood harvested from a dead or [[incapacitated]] lycanthrope in its animal or hybrid form. A creature subjected to this poison must succeed on a DC 12 Constitution saving throw or be cursed with lycanthropy (see the Monster Manual). The curse lasts until removed by the [[remove curse]] spell or similar magic.

The type of lycanthropy depends on the lycanthrope used to create the poison. To determine the type of lycanthropy randomly, roll a **d6**:

|d6|Lycanthropy|
|---|-----------|
|1-3|[[Wererat]]|
|4-5|[[Werewolf]]|
|6|[[Wereboar]]|
