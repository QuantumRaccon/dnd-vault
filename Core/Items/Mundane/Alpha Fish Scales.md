[[Alpha Fish]] scales are coveted spell components. When a spellcaster uses an alpha fish scale as a spell component while casting an enchantment or illusion spell, the spellcaster can increase the DC of the spell by 1 or increase the DC of the Intelligence (Investigation) check to determine if the illusion is false by 1. If the spell is 4th level or higher, the scale is consumed in the casting of the spellâ€”otherwise, it remains.
