# Example

## THE STRONG START

During the last great trade-day before winter falls upon the village of Whitesparrow, an iron-armored caravan filled with hooded hobgoblins attacks the bazaar. Their goal is to steal weapons and armor—as well as an old book possessed by Paula Dustyfingers, the curio vendor. 

## POTENTIAL SCENES

- Investigate the armored caravan.  
- Talk to Paula Dustyfingers the curio seller about the book the hobgoblins wanted.  
- Talk to the archivist Aluvena the Keeper, the custodian of Whitesparrow history.  
- Find Littletoes, a goblin who escaped from the battle.
- Follow the hobgoblins’ trail back to the Watchtower of Set
- Travel through the goblin warrens beneath the tower. 
- Sneak into the inner keep of Grayspire, the hobgoblins’ mountain fortress. 
- Face the hobgoblin leader Volixus in the throne room.

## SECRETS AND CLUES


- The hobgoblins are building a terrible
city-destroying war machine in the western
mountains.
- The war machine was orged in the fires o
the Nine Hells centuries ago, and was lost in a
great battle.
 - The hobgoblins have gnome tinkerers and
alchemists working on the war machine, but it
isn’t clear whether those are prisoners or allies.
 - A hobgoblin hal-dragon veteran known as
Volixus the Burning Rage leads the hobgoblins.
-  In addition to his goblin and hobgoblin army,
Volixus has hired a band o ogre mercenaries
known as the Bonemashers.

Te hobgoblins have taken over a ruined
mountain ortress known as Grayspire.
• Centuries past, Grayspire served as the
ortress headquarters o High Lord Grandel
Whitesparrow, but it ell into ruin long ago.

which sits above tunnels connecting it to the
lower levels o Grayspire.
• Te library o Lord Whitesparrow might hold
old maps or clues to navigating the sewers and
tunnels beneath Grayspire.

Tis outline is about as long as notes prepared rom
the Lazy Dungeon Master’s checklist are ever going
to get, and can still fit easily onto a page or two o
paper. Your own notes might be even shorter. Tis
adventure might also end up running longer than
our hours, so we can either run it over a couple o
sessions or shorten it up. We can remove scenes like
the Watchtower o Set, or give the characters clues
earlier on that’ll get them into the castle aster.
